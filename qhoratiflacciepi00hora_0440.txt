404 ARS POETJCA.

our MSS.; hence paulum is rightly retained by Munro, e.g.
1. 410, in spite of Lachmann on 111. ¹0¹4· Augustus wrote
paulo in the Μοη. Ancyr. 111. 21, and so the MSS. have in
Verg. Ecl. lv. 1. On the other hand Paullus is the form of
the proper name on coins and inscriptions, though MSS. are
divided. Cp. Sat. Ι. 6, 41. The word is not directly connected

with paucus (as Roby, ἓ 868, says) but is more probably for
paurulus. Cp. Corssen 112 531—2.

vergit acl imum, ‘approaches the lowest’: i.e. is little better
than the worst.

379. armiS‚ not, as Orelli, such as are mentioned in the
next line, but ‘weapons’ sor sharn fights: cp. Ep. Ι. 18, 54.

380. pilae: indoctus nowhere else is followed by the gen.
but cp. sollers lyrae in v. 407, Roby§ 1320, S. G. ἓ 526. Cp.
Sat. 11. 2, 11 sen pila velox...seu le discus agit. For the various
kinds of hall-play cp. Marquardt Ram. Privalalt. 11. 420—425‚
or Primer of Rom. Ant. p. 37. The ball and quoit were held
in high esteem, but the hoop (trochus) was rather despised:
cp. Carni. 111. 24, 57, Ov. Trist. 11. 486, 111. 12, 22, Art. Am.
111. 383 sunt illis (sc. viris) celeresque pilae iaculumque trochique
armaque et in gyras ire coactns equus. The hoop was set with
rattling rings: cedat ut mgutis obvia turba troclzz's (Mart. XIV.

169).

381. spissae: Ep. 1. 19, 41, and v, 205. impune=merit0.
coronae: Ep. 1. 18, 53.

382. versus. It is better not to place a comma after ves-sus,

as Bentley does: nescio does not govern versus, but rather
fingere repeated.

383. liber, opposed to servus, ingenuus opposed to iiber-
tinus. Understand est, not, as Orelli, sum3 for to quidni we
supply audeat not audeam.

census...summam, cp. Cic. p. Flacc. 32, 80 voluisti magnum
agri modum censeri. . rum le audisset servos suos esse censum. Roby
ἓ 1127 says this is the only other instance of this construction of
censeor. Gell. vri. 13, 1 has classici dicebantur, qui cxxv. milia
aeris ampliusve censi erant, but this is later than Roby’s limits.
The construction with abl. is more common, and from this use
comes the very frequent meaning in later writers ‘to be valued or
distinguished for’: e.g. Mart. Ι. 61, 3 censetur Apona Livio suo
tellus: the accusative construction seems to have given rise to the
curious use in Ovid, Ep. Pont. Ι. 2, 137 hanc-...dilectam est inter
comites Marcia censa suas. For the equestrian census cp. Ep.
Ι. 1, 57.

384. .v1tio‚interpreted by Acron as v. corporis, hence qui
sanus est. But that is not to the point here: it means only ‘there
