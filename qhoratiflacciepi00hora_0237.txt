Bk. I. Ep. XVI.] NOTES. 201

69. captivum : i. e. a inan who is absorbed in the pursuit of
money, is not worthy of the name of a free inan : trent him as a
captive, and let him do the work sor which he is tit. Lehrs
objects that the passage is out of place here, ancl that v. 73 sol-
lows V. 68 better, if the intervening lines are omitted. But they
add a touch of scorn to Horacc⁷s treatment of the man who
⁶ makes haste to be rich', aud are in his best style.

70. durus ‘unsparingly‘‚ Ep. 1. 7, 91.

72. annonae prosit, i.e. let him serve to keep down the
price of com, by bringing in plenty from abroad. For the effect
of imported corn on agriculture in Italy, cp. Mommsen, Hc'sl.
111. 77. ·

penusque: this neuter form is quoted from Horace by
Servius and Priscian: some inferior MSS. have penum: Rohy

ξ 398, S. G. ξ 121. Cp. Cic. de Nat. De. 11. 27, 68 est omne,
quo vescuntur homines, penus.

73-79. A trulygood man will maz'nlm'n lzz‘s flarless inde-
pendence. An admirably vivid and dramatic adaptation of Eur.
Bacch. 492—498. Dionysus, in the guise of a young Lydian
stranger is brought before Pentheus, king of Thebes⁷ charged
with introducing the Bacchic orgies among the Theban women.
Students of contemporary literature will remember how happily
this passage is used by Cardinal Newnian (History of my li'e-
ligious Opim'ons, p. 294).

74. patique: Ep. 1. 15, 17, Cic. Tusc. 11. 7, 17 palium,
pmseret, non succzmzhet. ‘

75. indignum: cp. v. 34. bona, in Euripides the long
tresses and the thyrsus, borne in honour of the god. ·

76. lectos, the most valuable part of the surniture of the
house. Ep. 1. 1,¹ 91. Cp. Cic. Parad. Ι. 8 neque ego unquam
bona perdidisse dicam, sz' quis pecus αιιί supellectilem amiserit.

argentum: Ep. 1. 6, 17.
in manicis: εἱρκταΐσι τ’ ἔνδον σῶμα σὸν φυλάξομεν. Eur.

79. hoc sentit : in Eur. the delivery is brought about by a
miraculous shaking of the palace of Pentheus (v. 605), but Horace
interprets to suit his own purpose.

moriar: cp. Sen. de Prov. 6, 7 aule omnia cavi (deus), ηε
'quid vos teneret invitos .· patet exitus .· si pugnare non vultis, licet
fugere.

linea, the calx or winning line (our ‘ tape’) at the end of a
tace-course : i.q. Ὑραμμὴ; cp. Eur. Antig. sr. 13 ἐπ’ α’κράν ἥκομεν
’γραμμήν κακῶν. Electr. 953 f. πρὶν ἄν τέλος γραμμῆς ἵκηται καὶ
πέρας κάμψῃ βίου.
