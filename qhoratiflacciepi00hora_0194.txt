158 HORA TI EPISTULAE.

litmus (now called archil or cudbear): cp. Quint. ΧΠ. 10, 75 ut
lana tincta suco citra purpuras [i.e. without any admixture of
the genuine purple] placet ; at si contuleris Tyriae lacernae,
conspectu melioris obruatur, ut Ovidius [Rem. Am. 707] ait.
Aquinum was at this time a large and flourishing city, but there
is nowhere else any reference to its dye-works. For purpura,
cp. Mayor's suu note on Juv. Ι. 27. The stem of Sidon is
always Sidon-‚ except once in Silius, but ὅ is often found for
metricat reasons in the adjective. camdus ‘as a connoisseur’,
Sat. 11. 7, 101. ostro dative.

28. propiusve medullis ‘ closer to his heart', i. e. one
which he will feel more deeply: propiusve has sar more support

than propiusque, and was rightly restored by Bentley: Macleane
writes ‘ 1 prefer -que'.

30. plus nimio ‘quite too much ', lit. much more than they

should: nimio is the abl. of measure, and is used in the sense so
common in comedy‚ = multo. So not only in a letter by Antonius
(Cic. ad Att. X. 8, Α) but five or six times in Livy, e.g. Ι. 2, 3
‚tmn nimio plus quam salis tntum esset accolis rem Troianam
crescere ratus, ΙΙ. 37, 4 nimio plus quam vellem nostrorum
ingenia sunt mobilia. It is somewhat conversational, but cp.
Carm. 1. 18, 15; 33, 1·.

31. quatient: Carm. 111. 3, 4 mente quatit solida. pones,

{s in Sat. ΙΙ. 3, 16p0nena'um aequo animo, Ep. 1. 1, 103 16, 35,
arm. 111. 10, 9.

33. reges ‘princes’‚ i.e. the wealthy‚ as in Sat. 1. 2, 86, not,
1 think, as Orelli takes it, with a reference to the Stoic paradox.

34. cervus equum: this famssiar story is said to have been
invented by Stesichorus, in order to warn the people of Himera
not to place themselves in the power of Phalaris (Arist. Rhet.

11. 20, 5). Bentley on Phalaris Ι. p. 106 oddly prefers the
authority of Conon ‘a writer in Julius Caesar‘s time’ who gives

{elon las the name of the tyrant: but cp. Cope’s note on
ristot e.

³5. Ιηίῌοτεῆττων, as melior: κρείττων.
36. opes ‘help’‚ so more commonly in the singular.

37. victo ridens: I have followed L. Miiller and Munro in
admitting this conjecture into the text, although Bentley's words
perhaps remain the fittest comlnentary; ‘illud viclor violens in
mendo cubare facile senti03 medicinam tamen polliceri vix
audeo'. ⁷ Vz‘olens can hardly bear the sense which Ritter assigns
to it ‘qui vim sive exitium hosti tulit⁷3 still less can it express
(as Macleane thinks) the struggle with which the horse won his
