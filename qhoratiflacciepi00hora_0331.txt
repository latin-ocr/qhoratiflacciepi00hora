Ἐκ. 11. Ep. IL] NOTES. 295

19. insequeris-:ormam moraris ‘annoy’‚ as in Cic. in
Verr. 11. 78, 191 quid moraris? It is impossible with Ritter to
put vv. 18—19 into the mouth of the vendor, and to suppose
ἠμφιεετουτ-ονίει me’. Horace only uses the indicative in place
of the subjunctive for vividness.

21. talibus officim, i.e. such friendly attentioris as you are
now demanding from me. The case is probably. dative ‘of work
contemplated' (Roby ξ ῑῐ56, S. G. §480 as white takes it,
rather than abl. as in L. and S.

mancum: Sat. 11. 7, 88.

mea. is curiously out of place: still it is too bold to take it
with Mr Yonge as neut. plur. sor νηεετούμόν. Pronouns are
often attracted towards the beginning of a sentence.

22. iurgares: ‘scold': cp. note on v. 171.

rediret : much better in itself‚ and far better supported than
veniret, which Bentley <silently and perhaps by oversight) retains
from the older editions. Florus expected a letter from Horace
in answer to his own. Cp. Ep. 1. 13, 2.

23. tum, i. e. at the tirne when I told you this.

mecum facientia: Ep. 11. 1, 68.

24—25. You complain too thot I do not send you tlze poems
whiclz [promised. ’

24. attemptas ⁶ assail’, try to upset. super hoc ‘besides’=
ad lzoc, perhaps ablative here (cp. Sat. ΙΙ. 6, 3; 7, 88), although
in prose it would certainly have been accusative. It is less good
to take it as=a⁷e lzoc, as in Ep. 11. 1, 152, A. P. 429, Carm.
Saec. 18.

26—54. A soldier wlzo lmd fouglzt bravely wlzen poor would
not do tlte same when enrz'clzed. So l was once compelled, aster
I had lest Athens and taken part z'n tlze civil war, to take to poetry
as a means cffgettinga living. But now tlzat l lmve a competence,
I should be mad indeed not to prefer rest to writc‘ng.

26. Luculli, in the war with Mithridates B.C. 74—67. The
reason why this story is told here is gIven in v. 52. Porphyrion
calls the man Valerianus, which is not a proper name, but denotes
that he was one of the soldiers who had belonged to the army in
Asia, commanded by Valerius Flaccus in B.C. 85, and afterwards
by Fimbria, whom they deserted in favour of Sulla. They are
mentioned under this name also by Sallust, Hist. 111. 36 (Dietsch),
41 (Kritz). Cp. Mommsen Hist. 111. 306, 311.

viatica, properly ‘travelling money' [whence the usage in
the Church for the administration of the Eucharist in preparation
