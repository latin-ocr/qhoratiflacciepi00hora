304 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

interpretation, approved by Orelli, ‘even those who have given
>ears to quiet study sometimes fail to secure success as popular
poets, and how can I satisfy myself with what I can produce
amidst all this⁷ gives a less satisfactory connexion of thought.

81. sibi desumpsit ‘has chosen as blshome'. vacuas: Ep.
ἸΙ. 7, 45 vacnum Tibur.

83. curis ‘studies'‚ ἐπιτηδεύματα, especially philosophy.

statua taciturnius: cp. Sat. ΙΙ. 5, 40 infantes statuas: Lucian
Imag. Ι. ἀχανῆ σε καὶ τῶν ἀνδριάντων ἀκινητότερον ἀποφανεῖ.

exit, ‘turns out’ ‚not necessarily at Athens, as some have ex-
plained, but still less at Rome, as Orelli says, which is at variance
with the contrast in hic.

86. digner, not quite :conen a reading found in some MSS.,
but rather am I to think myself fit for this task, and so set my
heart upon achieving it?⁷ A rhetorical question of this kind is
usually not introduced in Latin by the ‘and', which would be
natural' m English.

87—105. R'ftlzh', mutual admiration lzas reached suclz a pilclz
licre, that l can find nofizwnr unless l am wz'lling to humour and
flatler εἶναψ one in my turn, but ί] I restare lo write, I can live at

87. frater...u†, alter. This line can hardly be genuine, as
it stands. All attempts to explain fi¹ate1¹...ut asztam fraterno
animo ul, and to defend the expression by Sat. Ι. 1, 95 quidam...
dim s ut amm ¹ctm nummos [where however the true reading 15 pro-
bably qm tam] or Sat. Ι. 7, 13 27 afmt ῑαριίαίίἣ ut ultzma dzvzder ἐἰ
πίσω (cp. Sat. ΙΙ. 7, 10), break down utterly: sr'ater 15 not an
adjective of quality with which an adverb of degree can be easily
understood. Nor is the ‘Globe' rendering legitimate: ‘There
were two brothers at Romez—their compact was that the one
etc.' Bentley, who well explained (against Heinsius) the con-
nexion of the passage with the general line of thought in the
epistle, admitted that the text as it stood was indefensible, and
added ‘magni sane emerim interpretem, qui locum hunc expedire
possit'. His own suggestion (though not regarded by him as
certain enough to be placed in the text) was Pactus emt Romae
consulto rhetor ‘a rhetorician at Rome had bargained with a
lawyer’c a construction which he illustrates with his usual fulness.
Meineke thought that a line must have been lost, owing to the
copyisffs eye falling on two similar syllables recurring3 and would
read γ

alterius laudum sic admirator ut] alter
alterius etc.
