1. bono: cp. Ep. 1. 9, 4 (note), and Furneaux’s excellent
study of the character os Tiberius in his edition of the Annals
of Tacitus, Introd. c. vm.

claroque refers to the high birth and position of Tiberius,

if we accept the earlier date for the epistle: if we take the later

gffssiivcarries also a reference to his military exploits. Cp.
. 4.

3. Tibure (for the form cp. Ep. Ι. 8, 12 note) vel Gabiis
shows that the boy was of Latin birth, not one of the less
valuable slaves, imported from the East.

4. candidus ‘fair’ of complexion‚ as in Sat. 1. 2, 123, not
fuscus, like Hydaspes in Sat. 11. 8, 143 or perhaps ‘without
blemish'. It would be out of place to refer it here to his moral

qualities.

talos ad imosi a proverbial expression: cp. Cic. pro Rosc.
C. 7, 20 nonne ab z'mz's unguibus usque ad verticem summum ex
fraude, fallaciis, mendaciis constare totns vedetur? v

5. fiet eritque, mere tautology on the part of the fluent
slave—dealer withan imitation of legal surplusage: there can be
no suggestion, as Schiitz supposes, in erit, that the boy will not
run away.

nummorum mnibus octo, about Am, a very low price sor
a slave with any attractions and accomplishments. The servi
litterati of Calvisius Sabinus eost 100,000 sesterces each (Seneca
Ep. XXVII. 7). The value of slaves at Rome naturally ranged
within very wide limits (cp. Wallon, Histoire de l’Esclavagg 11.
159—174): Cato the Censor never gave more than 1500 drachmas
(about 2554) sor any slave (Plut. Cat. 1), and in his censorship
required that a slave under twenty years of age, who had been
purchased for 10,000 asses (about A30) or more, should be as-
sessed at ten times the price paid sor him, on which assessment
he then laid a triple tax in order to discourage this form of
extravagance (Liv. XXXIX. 44). Martini on the other hand
(1. 59, 1, 11. 63, ι) speaks of young slaves as sold sor 100‚000
sesterces (nearly A800). Perhaps from ,550 to ,4⁴60 may be
taken as an average price for an ordinary slave : Davus in Sat.
11. 7, 43 speaks of himself as bought sor 500 drachmae: i.e.
about 25²0· [Under the Republic a thousand sesterces were
