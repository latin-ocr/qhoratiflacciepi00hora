263. non quivis. Cicero judges more savourably the per-
ception of a popul ir audience. cp. de Orat. 111. 50, 196 at z'n

264. et...poetis ‘and indulgence is granted to Roman poets,
which poets ought not to need’. Peerlkamp, thinking that this
line and the preceding one contain an objection made to
Horace⁷ s too great strictness‚ to which he replies m the following
line, reads nec data, etc. and Sch'utz much approv.es But the
lines are just as well taken as a concession made by Horace:

‘I admit that etc.y poetis' 15 strictly the dative, but requires to
be understood again as an ablative after z'mhgna.

265. vager ‘am I to move unchecked by law?' an: Bentley
adopted the reading ut, which has very slight authority, carrying
on the question, and interpreting: ‘All the audience do not
notice faults, and those who do, excuse them. Am I therefore
deliberately to depart from the rules of art, and write carelessly,
feeling sure that I shall be safe, in my cantion within the limits
of the indulgence granted, even though I should suppose that
every one will see my saults'. This makes good sense: but it
is not necessary to depart from the MSS. It is equally good to
interpret: ‘Or am I to assume that all will notice my faults,
and therefore avoid them, cautiously keeping within the sphere
in which I may hope for indulgence? The latter is the alterna-
tive to be chosent, but Horace immediately goes on to say that
this is not enough ofitself. The Greek models show that more
than a mere avoidance of faults is needed for excellence. Ribbeck
puts the mark of interrogation at mea, and joins turm-...cautus
with vitavi: this would be an improvement, if it were not for
the awkwardness of denique coming so late in the sentence.
Orelli⁷s view ‘Or falling into the opposite error, am Ι to suppose
that all will see my faults, but none the less consider myself
safe from ,censure provided I take care that no verses which
are too rough or absolutely unmetrical drop from me constantly?'
does not bring out sufficiently the contrast of the two alternatives. ·
the latter in his interpretation is merely equivalent to scmhew
lzcenter. In this case he could hardly be said erravisse culpam.
For tutus ‘cautious' cp. v. 28.

268. vos sc. Pisones.

269. nocturna...diurna. There is a curious resemblance
inthe form of the verse to Ep. 1. 19, 1 1.

2⁷0. vestri, the reading of all MSS. of any importance,
and as Bentley showed, much better in itself than nostri, which
would be out of place' in the mouth of a freedman like Horace.
