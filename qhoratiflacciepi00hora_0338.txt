30² ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE.

purae, ‘clear'; i.e. free from obstructions: cp. Ov. Met.
111. 709 purus ab arboribus, spectabilis undique campus: Liv.
XXIV. 14, 6 puro ac patenti campo.

72. calidus, ‘in hot haste'3 cp. Sat. 1. 3, 53: Carm. 111.
14, 27, where however the meaning is rather ‘impetuous’.
redemptor, ‘a contractor’ for buildings, as in Carm. 111. 1, 35
lzuc frequens caementa demittit redemptor cum famulis. mulis
gerulisque, instrumental ablatives, indicating how the con-
tractor showed his impetuosity. It is quite illegitimate to say
with Macleane that ‘ cum is omitted’: Kriiger compares military
expressions such as ingenti exercitu, omnibus copiis, quadrato
agmine: but the addition of the epithet makes all the difference
(Roby ἓ 1234); equis virisque in Cic. de Off. ΙΙΙ. 33, 116 is
evidently proverbial (cp. Holden's note). The geruli, ‘porters’
are the same as thefamltlz' of the passage in the Odes. The
word does not appear to be used elsewhere in quite so general
a meaning.

73. machina, apparently ‘a crane ' which ‘swings ’ (torquet)
stones or beams needed sor building, properly called tolletw,
but sometimes by a metaphor like our own, ciconia, cp. γέρανος.

74. robustiS, i.e. built for heavy loads, not quite as Orelli
‘magnis largumque spatium occupantibus', Sat. Ι. 6. 42 si
plostra ducenta concurrantque soro tria funera. The form plos-
trum was the more vulgar one, therefore it is admitted only in
the Satires, while the evidence of MSS. in the Odes and Epistles
is in favour of planstrum. Cp. Suet. Vesp. 22 Mestium Florum
consularem, admonitus ab eo, plaustra potius quam plostra dicenda,
postero dle Flaurum salutavit. The use of wheeled vehicles
was forbidden in Rome until ten hours after sunrise, except in
the case of those employed in connexion with public buildings,
temples, etc. (as probably here and in Juv. 111. 214), of market-
carts leaving the city, and of certain privileged persons. Cp.
Marquardn Ram. Privatalt. ΙΙ. 319 ff. Friedlander, Sitteng.
Ι. ch. Ι. App. 3.

75. fugit3 Galen noticed among the signs of madness in a
dog τό ἀλόγως τρέχειν, which is still regarded as an indication of
srenzy: furit, the reading of some inferior MSS. would be need-
less aster rabiosa.

76. inuno: Ep. 1. 6, 17, note.

1 ἿἹΙ.1 scriptorum, of poets especially, as in Ep. 11. 1, 36 and
e sew ere.

urbem: the great preponderance of MS. authority is in
favour os the singular here. Many recent editors have preferred
the plural, on the ground that the singular after what has gone
