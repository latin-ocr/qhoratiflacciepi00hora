probably spurious. For the construction cp. Ep. 1. 1, 13; 18, 5S;
19, 263 583 11. 1, 208.

26. Cantaber: Dio Cass.x,1x.11 τούς τε ἐν τῇ ἡλικίᾳ πάντας
ὀλίγου διέφθειρε καὶ τοί ς λοιποὺς τά τε ὅπλα ἀφείλετο καὶ ἐς τὰ. πεδία
ἐκ τῶν ἐρυμνῶν κατεβίβασεν. 'lhis u as in B. C. 20, althoug h the
campaign was not closed tillr.. C. 19. Cp. Merivale lv. 1 0.

27. Armenius. The submission of Armenia to Tiberius had
been a bloodless one. Cp. Tac. Ann. 11. 3. At the request os

the Armenians Augustus had sent to them Tigranes, a prince ψ

who had been living in exile at Rome, to take the place of a
king whom they had dethroned and murdered. For the various
coins of Augustus, bearing the legend ARMEMA CAPTA, cp.
Mommsen Mon. Ancyr. p. 77. Orelli refers also to 0110 having
a figure of Armenia on bended knee, but Ι have not been able 10
veril‘y his reference.

Prahates is the spelling of the better MSS: Phraates has
much less authority, both here and in Carni. 11. 2, 17. The
Mon. Aneyr. V. 54, VI. Ι, 4 has l'lzrates.

28. genibus minor=supplex: genibus is to he referred to
Prahates ‘inferior by his (bended) knees', i.e. thus testifying his
humbled position, not, as apparently Orelli, at the knees of
Caesar. There is something of exaggeration here too, although
Tacitus (Ann. 11. 1) says cunda veummtium (ΨΑ-ἀι ad Angustum
vaserat, and in the Mon. Ancyr. (p. 84 Momms.) Augustus says
Parthos trium exm‘cz'lmtm Romanorum spolia ct „mgna reddere milti
supplicesque amicitiam populi Romani petere coeat. Horace refers
to these surrendered standarcls again in Ep. Ι. 18, 563 Carm. lv.
15, 6; Ovid 1n Tr‘ist. 11. 27 and Fast.V1. 465.

29. defundit. the present seems to point to the time of
writing as that of late summer in B.C. 20. The perfect (affudit
has less support, and is due to awrong assimilation to cecidit and
accepit: dg'ffzmdit or diffiedit have but slight authority and are
not so suitable in meaning here. It is needless to suppose with
Ritter that this letter was written in the summer of B.C. 19. There
would have been time enough sor news of the successes in Spain
and the East in B.C. 20 10 reach Rome before the end of 1110
summer: and Ep. Ι. 3, 3 does not necessarily imply that it was
winter when Horace wrote that letter.
