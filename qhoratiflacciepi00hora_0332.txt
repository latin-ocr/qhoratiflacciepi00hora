for the last journey], then a soldier’s private stock of money,

his savings, as here, and in Tac. Hist. Ι. 57, 5, Suet. Caes.
LXVIII.

27. ad assem, quite equivalent to our to a penny': cp. ad
unum, Verg. Aen. V. 687, and often.

28. vehemens: this form is given here in all MSS„ but the
same is the case in v. 1 20 where the metre makes vemens necessary.
Lachmann on Lucret. 11 . 10²4 (nam tibi vementer nova res molitur
ad auris accedere) shows that vehemens is not necessarily an ana-
paest anywhere before a letter of Marcus Aurelius to Fronto
(p. 53), that in Lucretius 111. 152, 482 and VI. 517 there is good
authority for vemetzS, and that even Cicero uses vemens .· cp. Boot
on ad Att. VIII. 5, 1. Probably vemens is right here too.

lupus, another instance of the use of metaphor for simile,
which is so common in Horace. Ep. I. 1, ¹23 2, 42; 7, 74;
10, 42. [Perhaps a camp word in this application: cp. Liv.
ΙΙΙ. 66, 3 occaecatos lupos intestina rabie occasionem opprimendi
esse : Ov. Trist. 1. 2, 17 eques instructus perterrita moenia lustrat
more lupi. J. S. R.]

32. donis honesti& ‘gifts of honour’, such as the corona
muralis, the hasta pura, phalerae, torques aureae, etc. The vet.
Bland. has opimis, which one editor (Stallbaum), but probably
only one, has ventured to adopt. It is a clear instance of the
tendency to arbitrary alterations, which appears so perplexingly
in this famous MS. by the side of precious indications of the
genuine tradition.

33. super, ‘in addition’‚ adverbial. bis dena. sestertia,
about A} 170. nummum, not very commonly used after sestertia,
denotes here ‘in cash'.

34. sub hoc tempus: Ep. 1. 16, ‘22 (note). praetor here in
its original sense, as ‘general’z στρατηγός is the regular Greek re-
presentative of the word, even when used os the praetor urbanus.

36. mentem, ‘resolution’: it would be hard to find a passage
in prose, where mens so nearly approaches to the force of animus,
or rather animi: cp. Verg. Aen. XII. 609 de77zz'ttunt mentes, for
