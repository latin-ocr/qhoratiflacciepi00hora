226 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

dinian MSS. (among others) have qztz’porzz'l, but qui has been very
generally recognized as due only to a false assimilation to Iovis.
It is almost necessary to have a limiting object to orare.

pon-it is so very commonly used by Horace in the sense os
‘lay down’(Car1n. 111. 2, 19; 10, 93 1V. 12, 25; Sat. 11. 3, 16;
Ep. 1. 1, 103 10, 313 16, 353 A.P. 469) that it is difficult to
believe that he used the word here in the sense of ‘bestow'.
The confusion between D and P is one of the most common in
uncial MSS. The passage in Carm- Ι. 34, 14 s. hinc apicem
rapax Fortuna cum stridore acuto sustulil, lzz'c posuisse gaudet,
which decided Bentley, after some hesitation, to accept ponit, is
not closely parallel, for there the action is more vividly pictured
than here. On the other hand, if ponit had corne by simple
corruption from donat we should have expected to find the
intermediate stage ponat (found in one MS.) more widely
diffused3 and if ponit was the original reading, donat would be
an almost inevitable gloss. Hence it is perhaps best on the
whole to retain ponit. [⁴⁶1 take the word to have the meta-
phorical sense corresponding to its literal use of banquets (Sat.
11. 2, 233 4, 14; 6, 643 8, 91). Jupiter ‘sets before' us things
as his guests.'' J. S. R. This is supported by the similar use of
azgfert]

112. det, vitam : cp. Ov. Pont. ΙΙ. r, 53 di tibi dent annos!
a te nam cetera sumes .· Trist. V. 1 1, 15 nec vitam nec opes nec ius
milzz‘ civis ademit.

mi: it is noteworthy that almost all MSS. have the unmetrical
milli: so often-even the best have a genitive in -z'c', where the
mette requires z.

EPISTLE XIX.

This Epistle recalls the tone of Satires IV. and X. in Book
Ι. The epistolary form is more completely than elsewhere in
this book a mere f01·m; but it is natural that Horace's seorn
of his imitators and rejoinder to his critics should be addressed
in the first instance to his patron Maecenas. The letter cannot
be earlier than the publication of the first three books of the
Odes: otherwise there is nothing to fix its date. It is evidently
separated by a considerable interval from Carm. IV. 3, when
envious carping criticism had been silenced by the general
recognition of the poet's nierits: Romae principis urbium drg-
ncztm‘ suboles inter amabiles valum ponere me choros, et iam
drale minus mordeor invido.
