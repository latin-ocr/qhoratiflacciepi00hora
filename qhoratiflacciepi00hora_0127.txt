Bk. Ι. Ep. L] NOTES. ” 91

8, 103 Ep. Ι. 19, 37. Cicero apparently never* uses it either iu
this general sense, nor of an individual-

rex eris si recte facies: Isidor. Or. vm. 3, 4 gives the full
trochaic tetrameter: νεῖν eris, si ναὶ-ἴε fizcics, sl mm sitrics ndu
em's. The meaning is plainly ‘if you play well, we will make
you our king’: an ambiguous meaning of recle, which Horace
turns to his own purpose. Conington's ‘deal fairly, youngster‚
and we'll crown you king’ seems to miss the point. Fair play
alone is not enough sor distinction in games.

60. hie: Roby§ 1068.

61. nil conscire sibi, ‘ to be conscious of no guilt ' ε the use
of sibi after an imperative is somewhat like that in Cic. de Nat.
D. Ι. 30, 84 sibi dar-plicare, ib. 44, 122 utilitatum suarum, where
the subject is indefinite, although in the one case the second
person, in the other the first has preceded.

62. Roscia...lex: L. Roscius Otho, trib. pl. in B.C. 67,
carried a law that the first sourteen rows of the cavea at the
theatre, next to the orcheslm which was occupied by the senators,
should be reserved sor the equites: the law was very unpopular,
and in 13.C. 63 Roscius was hissed in the theatre (Plut. Cic. 13),
but the people were pacified by Cicero, and Roscio theatralis
auctori legis zgnoveb‘zmzt, notatasque se [sc. tribus] discrimine sedis
aequo animo tulerunt (Plin. N. H. VII. 30). Cp. Iuv. 111.
153—159 ‘execzt’, inquit, ‘sz' pudor est, et de pulvino surgat
equestri, cuius res legi non stgfficz't...sic libitum vana, qm' nos
dzktinxit, Othoni ἶ (with Mayor's notes).

sodes ‘ please ' : there is no reason to doubt the explanation
of the word given by Cic. Orat. 45, 154 ‘ libenter verba z'ttlzgrebaaezl,
ul sodes pro Si audes, sispro si vis ἐ sz‘ audes is found in Plaut. Trin.
244, and audeo=avidus sum originally. For o as the popular
pronunciation of au cp. Roby§ 250. The notion that it is the
vocative of a substantivezviffleie (cp. Froehde in Kuhn's Ztsch.
XII. 159), is sufficiently disproved by dic sodes, paler in Ter. Ad.
6433 ήθεῖος has its Latin cognate in sodalis Curt. Princ. Et. 1. p.
31²· Key’s derivation from si voles (L. G. ἓ 1361 n.) must be
wrong (1) because of the tense which is evidently present, (2)
because while d often becomes l, l does not pass into d(Roby
ἓ 174, 4), except in very rare instances (Corssen Ausspr. 12 2243
Nachtr. 274, 276).

63. nenia. ‘ ditty ’ or ‘ jingle’ ε there is nothing here about ‘ a
sort of a song of triumph ' as Macleane thinks. The form naenia
has but slight authority.

64. Curiis especially Curius Dentatus, the conqueror of
Pyrrhus. For the plural cp. note on Cic. de Orat. 1. 48, 211.
decantata ‘ ever on the lips of'. Cic. de Orat. ΙΙ. 32, 140.

65. facias, jussive subjunctive in quasi-dependence on a
repeated suadet: Roby ἓ 1606, S. G. ἓ 67²·
