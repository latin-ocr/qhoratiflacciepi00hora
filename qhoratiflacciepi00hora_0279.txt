the traditional explanation. Cp. Roby Vol. 1. pp. 381, 384.
Mr Palmer suggests that the meaning may be ‘grey in front’.
comparing ἀπὸ κροτάφων πελόμεσθα πάντες Ὑηραλέοι, Horace
speaks in Carm. 11⁴. 11, 14 of himself and Hirpinus as rosa canos
odorati capillos: the date of this ode cannot be sixed precis-ely,
but it was written at latest three or four years before this epistle.
In B.c. ²4 (Carm. 111. 14, 25) he is albescens.

solibus aptum ‘ fond of sunning myself'. This is the
reading of all MSS. and of the scholiasts, and may, I think, be
defended. Keller quotes Ov. Met. ΙΙΙ. ⁵96 portus puppibus
aptos, which is not very similar, nor is Lucret. vr. 961 huc
accedit uti non onmia quae iacz'unlur corpora cumque ab rebus,
eodem praedita sensu atque eodem pacto rebus sint omnibus apta,
which he regards as completely analogous, sor apsa is there
‘adapted to affect' rather than ‘fitted to enjoy’. Sat. 11. 5, 45
aptus amicis is really a closer parallel3 so is Sat. 1. 3, 29 aptus
acutis naribus ‘fitted to meet': the word is rather a favourite
one with Horace, occurring 14 times. Cp. Juv. νυ. 58 cupidus
silvarum aptusque bibendis fontibus Aonidmn. Mr Reid com-
pares Ov. Met. XIV. 25 Circe, neque enim flammis habet aplius
ulla talibus ingenium, and thinks that it is simply an inverted
way of saying that the sun was suited to Horaee's constitution,
a case of hypallage in sact3 so Met. 1. 681 aptam pastoribus
umbram. But few passages in Horace have given occasion sor
more numerous attempts at emendation, sor the most part very
infelicitous. Kriiger (Anhang p. 375—6) mentions seven such
attempts (besides Herbst’s solibus ustum, which he himself
adopts), and Sehiitz adds one more, sollicitatum (!). It seems to
rne that there are more serious objections against one and all
of the proposed readings than against the text of the MSS. ⁷

For the practice of sunning one's sels (apricatio) ep. Plin. Ep.
ΙΙΙ. 5, 10 (os the elder Pliny) aestate, si quid olii, iacebat in
sole...post solem plerumque frigida lavabatur. ib. VI. 16, 5
usus ille sole, mox fm'gida. 111. 1, 8 (of Spurinna) in sole, si caret
vento, ambulat nudus. The usual place sor this was the laelio-
caminus ⁶ sun-oven’ built on purpose. Cp. Mayor on Juv. XI.
203, and Pers. v. 179 aprici senes.

25. irasci celerem: Horace’s quick temper may possibly
be referred to in Carm. 111. 9, 22 improbo iracundior Hadria ,-
and more directly in Sat. 11. 7, 35. It is exaggerated in Sat.
11. 3, 323 non dico horrendam rabiem.

27. Decembres: Suetonius gives the date of Horace's birth
as sexto idus Decembris. The year of his birth is fixed by Carm.
111. 21, 1 o nata mecum consule Illanlio, and by Epod. 13, 6
tu vina Torquato move consule pressa meo to the consulship of

L. Manlius Torquatus and L. Aurelius Cotta in B.c. 65, a date
which Suetonius also gives. <
