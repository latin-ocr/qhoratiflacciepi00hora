26. Many MSS. and some old editions begin a new epistle
here, failing to notice the connexion between this sketch of
Maenius the glutton‚ and Horace’s humorous expression of his
intention to live on the best fare that he can get. For the rapid
transition cp. Ep. 1. 7, 14, and 46.

MaemUS‚ a character attacked also by Lucilius, and mentioned
in Sat. Ι. 3, 21, perhaps also in Sat. 1. 1, 101 (but cp. Ritter ad
loc.). Porphyrion says ‘qui de personis Horatianis scripserunt,
aiunt Maenium scurrilitate notissimum Romae’. He was said
to have prayed aloud in the Capitol on the Kalends of January
that he might owe 400‚000 sesterces, explaining his prayer to
one who asked him the meaning of it, by saying that he owed
at the time 800,000. some have supposed, but without good
grounds, that he was the Pantolabus of Sat. 1. 8, 11.

27. fortiter ‘in a spirited sashion'; ironical‚ like Pers.
VI. 21 ln'c bona dente grandia magnanimus peragi! puer.

urbanus (Ep. 1. 9, 11) is best connected with scurra, as in
Plaut. Most. 15 tu urbanus vero scurra, deliciae popli, rus milzi
tu obiectas? From Plaut. Trin. 202 urbani assidui cz'ves‘, quos
scurras vocanl, we see that scurra had not quite the same sense
as in Horace, but meant rather ‘lounger', ‘gossip ². In Catull.
XXII. 2 the urbanus equals the scurra of V. 12, a ‘wit ', quite
in a good sense, a meaning which is found even in Cicero (pro
Quinct. 3. 11 nam neque parum facetus scurra Sex. A'aevz'us
neque inhumanus praeco est unquam exz'stz'malus), although from
de Orat. 11. 60, 247 it appears that the bad sense was beginning

to be predominant. Hor. Sat. 1. 5, 5² shows the change
complete ; scurra :parasitus ‘ spunger '.

28. praesepe ‘crib', cp. Plaut. Cure. ²27 tormento non
retineri potuit ferreo quin recipc'ret se huc esum ad praesepim
suam: so Eur. Eurysth. fr. 6 ἦν τις οἴκουν πλουσίαν ἔχῃ φάτνην.

29. inpransus, i. e. if he had had no meal that day: the
{zlsslsggg} was the first substantia] meal of the day, usually taken

civem...hoste ‘friend from foe': the earlier meaning of the
word lzostis=‘foreigner' (Cic. de Off. 1. 12, 373 Varro·L. L.
V. 3 lum eo verbo dicebant peregrinum) had become obsolete by
the time of Horace, and should not be thrust upon him here:
cp. Plaut. Trin. 102 hostisne an civis comedis, parvi pendere.
The form dignoscere has no support here: the word occurs first
in Horace (cp. Ep. 11. 2, 44), then in Ovid3 in prose in Colu-
mella and Pliny. Cp. Brambach Huffss‘b. p. 34.
