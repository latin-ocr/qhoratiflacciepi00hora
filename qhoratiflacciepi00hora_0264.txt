'¹228 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

suam ε nam hoc verbum militare est ' Porph.) the srenzied poets
among his troop of followers‚ they too have borne the traces of
their nightly potations. Lambinus and Bentley placed a full
stop at poetas, and a comma aster sanos, taking ut as a particle
os compara'son, but this is clearly less good.

male denotes either the deficieney of what is good or the
excess ot what is bad, like the prefix ve-: cp. vesanus, vegyandtlv
on the one hand, and vfpallidns on the other (Sat. Ι. 2, 129):
so male pertinax Carm. Ι. 9, 24, male dispar ib. 17, 253 but
malefidus (Verg. Aen. 11. ¹23), male gratus (Ov. Her. VH. 27)
etc. Cp. Sat. 1. 3, 45, and 48. The inspired frenzy of poets
has been a commonplace at least since the days of Democritus.
Cp. Cic. Div. Ι. 37, 80 negat sine furore Democritus quemquam
poetam magnum esse posse, quod idem dicit Plato (Phaedr. 245 A).
Cp. A. P. 295, Sat. 11. 3, 322.

4. satyris faunisque: the Satyrs were always regarded as
attendants of Bacchus: cp. Carm. Π. 19, 4. The Fauns are
here introduced as typifying the earliest Italian poetry: cp.
Ennius in Cic. Brut. 19⁷ 71 z-'ersz'bus quos olim Fanni vatesque
canebant, and Mommsen Hist. Ι. 230: ‘the earliest chant in
the view of the Romans, was that which the leaves sang to
themselves in the green solitude of the forest. The whispers
and pipings of the ‘favourable spirit' (Faunus from favere) in
the grove were repeated to men by the siuger (vates), or by the
songstress (fasmena, ccll'mcnla) who had the gift os listening to
him, with the accompaniment of the pipe, and in rhythmically
measured language (casmen, afterwards carmen, from canere) ².

paler sitiens Ennius ante bibit: and Plato's 0' πατὴρ ἡμῶν Παρ-
μενίδης. There may also be a reference to the fact that he lived
in days of old (cp. senis of Lucilius in Sat. ΙΙ, 1, 34), but not, as
Ritter supposes, to the age which he reached. Ennius said of
himself nunqnam poetar, nisi ,η’ podager.

8. prosiluit ‘ sprang forth ⁷, as if eager to take part himself
in the wars of which he was singIng. Yet ‘he celebrates the
