lyrics) that Horace bought himself the clerkship in the Quaestors'
office, which put him out of the reach of absolute want, before
he secured the patronage of Maecenas. These poems probably
included some of the earlier epodes and satires, ‘which have no
value, except as showing how badly even Horace could write'
(Martin), and more of the same kind which have happily been
lost. But Horace is of course hurnorously exaggerating in his
suggestion that the greater part of his poetry had been produced
under the sti-ess of poverty. He had received his Sabine estate
by about B.C. 34, and probably all his works‚ except the first
book of Satires, were published after this date. Cp. Theocrit.

that, as there is no sufficient evidence that the booksellers pald
authors for their works (cp. Marquardt leiim. Primnum? p. 805),
Horace can only mean that ⁶ nillil ab eis quos impugnavissct sibi

There is no need to suppose with the Schol. that cicula is here x

put loosely for elleborus: the plants are quite unlike, and the
medicinal use of hemlock‚ denied by Lambinus, is common even
yet. Persius, as usual, imitates in v. 144—5 calido sub pectore
mascula bilis intumuit, quod non extinxerit urna cicutae. For
