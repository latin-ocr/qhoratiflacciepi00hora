ἕ ²59· Plutarch Lucull. e. 39 tells the story thus: ‘When a
praetor, with great expense and pains‚ was preparing a spectacle
for the people, and asked him to lend him some purple robes for
the persormers in a chorus, he told him he would go home and
see, and if he had got any, would let him have them: and the next
day asking how many he wanted, and being told that a hundred
would suffice, bade him take twice as many: on which the poet
Horace observes, that a house is but a poor one, where the valu-

albles unseen and unthought ot do not exceed all those that meet
t ie eye'.

Greek garment, would not naturally be found in large numbers
in a Roman house.

50. qui dictet nomina, the so-called nomenclator, who ae-
companied a candidate on his canvass, in order to whisper to him
the names of influential citizens whom he might meet. Cp. Cic.
pro Mur. 36, 77 quidquod habes nomenclatorem? z'n co quidem
fallis ct deustis, uam 52' nomine appellari abs le cives tuos honestum
est, turpe est eos notiores esse servo itm quam tibi. In B-C. 72
when Cato was standing sor the military tribuneship, the employ-
ment of nomenclatores was forbidden by law, though the law was
rarely obeyed. Nine years later it had been repealed or was
regarded as obsolete, even by Cato. Cp. Plutarch, Cat. 8.

51. fodicet, ‘nudge’2 the nomenclator is of course on the
outside of the path, his master having the wall to his right:
