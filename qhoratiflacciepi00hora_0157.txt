as confirmed by a senatusconsultum of the time of Augustus
(Dio Cass. LIV. 18) sorbade an advocate to receive any see under
pain of refunding four times the amount : and in any case no re-
proach to the invited guest, as some have strangely supposed.

Pergamum, who was accused of poisoning, and in whose trial
the most eminent orators of the day were engaged.

nato Caesare: Ritter takes this to be the birth of a Caesar,
i. e. of Gaius, the eldest son of Julia and M. Agrippa, the first
grandehild of Augustus, who was born about midsummer B.C.
‘203 cp. Dio LIV. 8 καὶ ἡ Ἰουλία τὸν Γάϊον ὀνομασθέντα ἔτεκε,
βουθυσία τέ τις τοῖς γενεθλίοις αὐτοῦ ἀΐδιος ἐδόθη. καὶ τοῦτο μὲν ἐκ
ψηφίσματος ἐγένετο. This removes all difficulty as to aestivam.
But was it possible for a Roman under Augustus to understand
any one but the Emperor himself, when the name Caesar was
used without qualification? It is used in 32 other passages by
Horace, and in only two, Sat. 1. 9, 18, Carm. Ι. 2, 44, where the
context removes all possibility of doubt, it refers to Julius Caesar.
Hence it is hardly possible sor us to understand the word here,
as some have done, with that reference, although this assumption
would equally remove the difficulty, Julius having been born on
July 12th (Kal. Amit. in C. I. L. Vol. Ι. 306). The birthday of
Augustus sell on Sept. '23 (a. d. ix. Kal. Oct.)‚ and was observed
as a holiday: cp. Suet. Oct. LVII equites Romani natalem eius
sponte atque consensu biduo semper celcbmrunt. No doubt the
terrn aestivam could be applied with strict accuracy to any night
before the autumnal equinox‚ though it might not seem the most
natural epithet; but a difficulty is presented from the fact that
Horace (cp. Ep. 1. 7, 53 16, 16) and most of his friends would
not be likely to be in Rome at all during the unhealthy mouth of
September (cp. Juv. VI. 517 metuique iubet Septembris et Austri
adventum, and Mayor on Juv. IV. 56). Meineke (followed by
Haupt and Munro) attempted to remove the difficulty by reading
ftstivam: but (1) if this is the genuine reading, it is impossible to
understand how it should have been retained only in one or two
quite worthless MSS.: (2) it is very clumsy, so soon aster fissus
in 1. 9; and (3) the word festivus does not occur in any classic
poet, but is especially suited to comedy. Hence L. Mulier
simply marks the word as corrupt. No really satisfactory solution
of the difficulty seems to have been discovered. It is possible,
as Mr Reid suggests, that the poem is amere fancy piece‚ not
necessarily in close relation to actual facts.
