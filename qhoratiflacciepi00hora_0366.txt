ARS POETICA.

THE place now generally assigned to the Epistola ad Pisones,
as the third epistle of the second book, rests upon no ancient
authority. In the MSS. it always appears, detached from the
other epistles, either aster the Fourth Book of the Odes, or after
the Carmen Saeculare. H. Stephanus first placed it at the
end of his edition: and Cruquius set the sashion, which has
recently been revived, of denoting it as Epistolarum Lib. ΙΙ.
Ep. 111. The editors, who have given it this position, seem to
have been led to do so by their view as to the date of its pro-
duction. It has been commonly supposed to be the latest of
the works of Horace; and the want of structural completeness,
which it undoubtedly displays‚ if regarded as a poetical treatise
‘on the Art of Poetry', has been considered as a proof that it
was never finished, and probably was not published by the poet
himself. This theory has been further confirmed by the assump-
tion made as to the identity of the Pisones, to whom the epistle
was addressed. Porphyrion begins his commentary with the
words: lznnc librum, qui inscribitur de arte poetica, ad Lucium
Pisonem, qni possea urbis custosfnz't, eiusque liberos misit ,· nam et
ipse Piso pocla fitit et studiormn liberalium antistes. This Lucius
Piso was the son of the enemy of Cicero: he was born Β. C. 48,
and was consul in Β. C. 15. After some years’ absence in Parn-
phylia and Thrace he returned to Rome in B.C. 11, and was
granted the insignia of triumph for his victories over the Bessi
(Tae. Ann. VI. 10). Under Tiberius he was praefectus urbi, an
office which he held sor twenty years, according to Tacitus (cp.
Furneaux on Tac. Ann. VI. 1 1, 5), dying in A. D. 32 at the age of
80. Now it is just possible that this Piso had two sons, old
enough to be addressed as iuvenes, before the death of Horace
in B.C. 8, and Borghesi believes that he has discovered evidence
that one of them was consul szfflctzts in A.D. 7, in which case
he must have been born not later than B. C. 26 (Mommsen Ram.
Staatsv. ⁷1.2 553 note 4). But it is only by straining probabilities
to the utmost, that we can bring these young Pisos into con-
nexion with Horace 3 and the difficulty thus arising makes us
