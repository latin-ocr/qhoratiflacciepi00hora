63. tu t Carm. 1. 9, 16. compesce, a word of very doubtful
origin: either (1) from con and pasco (Roby 1. 253), or (2) from

65. 1re viam qua ε qua has the support of only a few MSS.
and those not the best. · but it is rightly preferred by most recent
editors since Bentley, as the reading most likely to have been
corrupted: cp. Verg. Aen Ι. 418 c07rz'puere vzam interea, qua
semzta maumam Georg. ΙΙΙ. 77 primus et ire viam3 Liv. XXXII.
1 1 pedztes (iubetf, qua dux monstmmt viam ire. 111 the last pas-
sage there is the same doubt as here, whether viam is governed
by* zre or monslml, in Livy the latter seems the more probable,
but here the rhythm, and the parallels from Vergil point to the

former. monstret has far more authority than the old reading
monstrat.

venaticus. ,catulus· the position of catulus may perhaps be
explained by taking ven. = ‘if meant for hunting’‚ rather than as
a simple epithet. But the form of the sentence is somewhat
awkward. We should have expected rather: ‘the hound is
trained to bark at the stuffed stag’s hide in the yard, before it be-
gins its service in the woods'. latravit with acc. also in Epod. e
5. 58. aula ‘court-yard' as in Homer osten (e.g. 11. lv. 433),
sor the usual Latin cohors or cors (cp. de Orat. 11. 65, 263, note),
not as in Ep. 1. 1, 87.

...bibit aure vudgus. Propert. iii. 6, 8 incz'pc’, suspensis auribus
ista bibam and the like. There is no need to derive the meta·
phor from dyeing.
