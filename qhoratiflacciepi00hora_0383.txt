NOTES. 347

though planned by Julius Caesar, was, according to the best
authorities, cornmenced only by Claudius (cp. Boissier, Promi-
nades Archdology'ques, p. 269; Burn, Rome ancl ll1e Campagna.
p. 370). But whether there is any reference here to this work,
as is almost universally assumed, is very doubtful: see on v. 67
below.

64. arcet, here with the acc. of the thing defended, and the
abl. of that from which it is defended. In prose it is more
common to have the acc. of the thing kept off, and the ablative
(with ab) ofthat from which it is kept off.

65. regis opus : Meineke thinks the singular here inde-
fensible, holding that it could only mean ‘the work of one who
was a king’, a title always rejected by Augustus, as by Julius:
and therefore suggests regimn opus, like regiae moles in Carm. 11.
15, 1. The suggestion has found much favour: and Ι am by no
means sure that the vulgate can be defended. Cp. Theocr. Ι. 32
’γυνά τι θεῶν δαίδαλμα.

palus diu. The MSS. read diu palus: Bentley first ob-
jected to the unparalleled shortening of palas, and suggested
palus prius: Gesner’s palus din, in which the long vowel is not
elided but shortened in hiatus, has in its favour si me‘ amas of
Sat. 1. 9, 38 and Vergil Ecl. VIII. 108 an qut* amant, Aen. VI.
507 ίέ amice. [Ovid Met. 1. 155 Pelio Ossam, and 111. 501
vale, vale inquit el Echo, are no more parallel than Verg. Georg.
Ι. 281 and Ecl. 111. 70 from which they are copied; and in
Propert. lv. (111.) 11, 17 Omphale in lantum Palmer ingeniously
reads Jardanz's in tantum] The hiatus is common in Lucretius
and Catullus: cp. Munro on Lucr. 11. 404 and Lachm. Comm.
p. 176. Although we cannot very confidently ascribe it to Ho-
race here, especially as the instances apparently similar shorten
the vowel in the first not the second thesis, it is less improbable
than the shortening of the final syllable of staltis, to which no
sort of parallel can be adduced. Hence the best recent editors
admit it. But Ι am by no means sure that Bentley⁷s palus prius

is not a safer correction. PRIV would easily become DIV.
Or if it dropped out after palus, diu might be inserted to make
out the line. Macleane entirely misunderstands Quint. 1. 7, 3
which in no way ‘shows that later poets had followed Horace’s
licence’. Both Servius and Priscian had the reading of the
MSS. and remark upon the shortened final syllable, but quote
no other instance of it.

sterilisve, though it has not much more authority than steri-
lisque, is clearly the better reading. “

The scholiasts explain this to refer to the draining of the
Pomptine marshes by Augustus: Pomptinas paludes Augustus
exsiccavit et habitabiles reddidit iniecto aggere lapidum et terrae.
