174 ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE.

EPISTLE XIV.

This letter, though nominally addressed to Horace’s farm-
bailiff, may be regarded as really an apology sor his love sor the
country, intended sor his friends at Rome. It thus takes up the
theme of Ep. X. and of the earlier part of Ep. V11.‚ while it is
the reverse of Sat. 11. 7. WVhether the bailiff deserved all the
hard things here said of him is a question which has been asked‚
‘but cannot be answered. Horace may have been intending to
give an example of the class of bailiffs, against whom Columella
utters his warning (Ι. 8, 1) ε praemoneo ne vilicum ex eo genere
servorum, qm· empore placuerunt, instituamus: ne ex eo quidem
ordine, qm urbanas aa· delicatas artes exercuerit. Socors et somni-
culosum genus id mancipiorum, otiis, campss, circa, theatris, aleae,
popinae, lupanaribus consuetum, nunquam non easdem ineptias
somniat (quoted by Orelli). There is no indication of the date.

d 1—5. Come, bailzffi let us see whether you ον I best do our
nty.

1. Vilice ἰ the form invariably found in good MSS. and in-
scriptions. Lachmann on Lucret. 1. 331 showed that l not ll
was used between a long z' and a short one ε so mille, but milia,
villa, but vilicus: cp. Roby ξ 177. The vz'lisus was the head
slave on a farm, whose duty it was to look after the proper dis-
charge of all sarm works: Cato de Re Rust. CXLII. vilici qfficz'a
quae sunt, quae dominus praecepit, ea omnia quae in fundo fieri
oportet, quaeque emi pararique eportet, eadem uti curet faciatque
moneo, dominoque dicto audiens sit. Cato gives in c. ΙΙ. a very
amusing account of the way in which a good economist will call
his vilicus to a strict account for any neglect or deficiency.

mihi me reddentis, ‘that makes me my own master again’,
i. e. where I can live as 1 please, without being distraeted by the
endless claims made upon me at Rome. Cp. Sat. ΙΙ. 6, 23——39‚
60 ff. The woods on Horace's Sabine estate are mentioned in
Carni. 111. 16, 29 silvaque iug‘ermn paucorum, and in Ep. 1.

’ 16, 9.

2. habitatum quinque focis, ‘though it furnishes a home
for five families'. Horace in Sat. 11. 7, 118 speaks of his
familia rustica as consisting of eight operae (‘hands’). Hence
Ritter presses the force os the past participle, thinking the mean-
ing to be that whereas five free coloni formerly worked the estate,
now eight slaves tilled it. But the lack of a present participle
passive 'in Latin often leads to the use of the perfect participle,
where a present would have been more natural (e. g. Liv. xxx.
