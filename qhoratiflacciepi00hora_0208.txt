172 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

seu fossae fluviorum. Hinc quoque dictae sunt Lamiae puerorum
voratrices. Ennius : silvarum saltus, latebras lamasque lutosas'
Comm. Cruq. The derivation which he suggests is of course
absurd: lama is sor lac—ma (cp. lana for lac-na, examen for
cxag-mcn, limus for lic-mus), while Lcimz'a (A. P. 340)ΞΛάμια
15 akin to Λαμυρός ‘greedy'. From the fact that the word is
found nowhere else (except in Festus) until it reappears in the
'Romance languages (cp. Diez Romame Dz'ctc'onary (ed. Donkin)
p. 266 3 and Dante Inf. xx, 99 non molto lza corso, clze trava una
lama), it seems to have belonged to the popular dialect. ‘ Push
on stoutly over hills, streams and bogs.’ If Horace is really
referring to the road between his Sabine estate and Rome, these
words are a ludicrous exaggeration, hardly to be defended by the
plea that the expression may have been proverbial.

11. Victor propositi ‘ achieving your purpose ’‚ ἐγκρατῆς τοῦ
σκοποῦ Or. ‘But when you’ve quell'd the perils of the road' Con.

12. sic...ne A. P. 152. Roby§ 1650. S. G. ξ 684.

13. rusticus agnum : ‘imaginem ridiculam propter con-
tinuas bestiolae motus et curam hominis ne in solum desiliat, ne
ab ipso sortasse laedatur? Or.

14. glomus has the support of the best MSS. Glomos,
though the usual reading before Bentley, has but slight support,
and is not Latin: globos has still less. Lucret. 1. 360 has in·
lanae glffmere, but the derivatives are always glfflmero etc.

Pyrria or the corrupted Pirria is the reading of all MSS.
collated by Keller. Most editors have adopted the form Pyrrhia,
but as Lachmann (on Lucret. p. 408) first remarked ‘neque
Graecae neque Romanaefiminae nomen est'. Macleane explains
it as ‘formed from Pyrrha, the name of a town in Lesbos, like
Lesbia, Delia etc.' But the adjective from Pyrrha is Pyrrhias
(Ov. Her. XV. 15), while Lesbius, Delius, Cve„ are common.
The name of a male slave, Pyrria, in the Andria of Terence
seems a corruption of Πυρρίας, which occurs in Aristophanes
and elsewhere, and is derived from πύρρος, ‘red'. The Scho-
liasts tell us that Pyrria was the name of an ancilla in a
play by Titinius, who stole a ball of wool, but being drunk
at the time, carried it so clumsily that she was easily detected.
As Titinius wrote comoediae togalae it is probable that the girl
was an Italian, in which case her name may well have been
l'urria, the form found in the MSS. being then a corruption
like Sylla for Sulla. Porphyrion actually has Plu-ria, and P.
Purreius is found on an inscription. L. MUller, Meineke and
others simply mark the word as corrupt.

15. pilleolo, a much better form than pileolo: cp. Fleckeisen,
FiinswJ)r Art. ²5· All good MSS. give it herc.
