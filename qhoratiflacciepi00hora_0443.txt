is no need to introduce it: and lenire strongly confirms rabidos.
In Lucret. IV. 712 rabidi leones, V. 892 rabidis canibus, the MSS.
have rapidi and rapidis, altered the former by Wakefield, the
latter by Bentley, with the approval of Lachmann (‘(lebebat
scire leones rapidos Latine dici non posse ') and Munro. I doubt,
with Conington, whether Lachmann does not go too sar, though
of course he only means ‘in the sense of ravening'. Keller
quotes rapidique leonis from Lucan VI. 337, but XVeber and
Weise both have rabidique, though (as usual) MSS. are divided.

394. urbis has much more authority (including Bland. vel.
and Bern.) than arcis, and it is hard to see why Bentley ignored
it3 still more why Orelli and Haupt should have preferred
the latter: the arx Thebana was founded by Cadmus, hence
called Cadmea, while according to Pausanias (lx. 5, 1—3) Arn-
phion and Zethus built the lower city. But the chronological
relation between Cadmus and the two brothers is given differ-
ently in different authorities : cp. Grote Histoi-y of Grecce, Part Ι.
c. xiv. It is curious that Homer knows nothing of Cadmus:
in the Odyssey (XI. 262) Amphion and Zethus build the walls of
Thebes. ‘The story about the lyre of Amphion is not noticed in
Homer, but it was narrated in the ancient ἔπη εἷς Εὐρώπην, which
Pausanias had read: the wild beasts as well as the stones were
obedient to his strains (Paus- IX. 5, 4). Pherecydes also re-
lated it (frag. 102 Didot)’ Grote 1. c. Cp. Carm. 111. 11, 2
movit Amphion lapides canendo: Ep. Ι. IS, 41.

395. blanda: Ep. 11. 1, 135.
396. sapientia, predicate, with the infinitives in apposition.

397. publica, etc. Horace follows the division of the
Roman law: cp'. Gaius ΙΙ. 2 summa itaque rerum divisio in duos
articulos diducitur: narn aliae snut divini iuris, aliae humani.
Divini iuris sunt veluti res sacrae el religiosae. 10. Hae autem
quae humani iuris sunt aut publicae sunt aut privatae.

398. concubitu vago=the venerem incertam of Sat. 1. 3,
109. The Epicurean conception of the early history of man
upon the earth, which Horace has in view here, is given fully in
Lucret. v. 925—1457. On much of it Darwin's Desa-nt cffzlffan
surnishes an interesting commentary. maritis ‘the wedded’.
Dig. XXIV. 1, 52 inter maritos nihil agitur. Apul. Met. VIII. 2
soboli novorum maritorum. The use here shows that it is not
solely ‘post-classical' as L. and S. say. But corlinges is more
common in this sense: cp. Catull. LXI. 237 boni coniuges, LXVI.
80 unanimis coniugibus.

roboreis. In has incidebant leges, unde adhuc Athenis legum
tabulae ἄξονες vocantur' Porph. They were also called κύρβεις;
