1. Vertumnum. Vertumnus seems to have been originally
the god of the annus vertens, i.e. both of the spring and os the
autumn, but especially of the latter with its rich stores os fruit :
cp. Colum. X. 308 mercibus ct vernis dives Vertumnus abundet .-
Propert. lv. 2, 11 seu quia vertentis fructum praecepimus anni,
Verlumnz' rursus creditur csse sacrum. Perhaps it was only
from the significance of his name that he was crcdited with the
power of changing himself into any form that he pleased. His
temple was in the Vicus Tuscus, one of the busiest streets 111
Rome, {ull of all kinds of shops, aud also of houscs of ill repute.
This circumstance may have contributed to the further explana-
tion of his name as the deus z'nv.·rtcndar2mz rerum, id cst merca-
turae (Asconius in Verr. 11. 1, 154, p. 199). Propertius (1v. 2)
has a charming poem upon him: and Ovid Met. le. 623 ff. tells
how he won the love of Pomona. Cp. Preller Ram. Mytlz. p.
397-9·

Ianum ε a temple of Janus was at the bottom of the Argile-
tum, which was not, as Macleane sayS‚ a street leading out of
the Vicus Tuscus, but on the opposite side os the Forum (Burn’s
Rome p. 79). near the Subura, also a disreputable quarter.
There are references in Martial to the book-shops in the Argile-
tum (1. 3, 1 ; 1 17, 9). Porph. says ‘ Ianus quoque similiter vicus
est’. Cp. Ep. 1. 1, 54 note.

spectare ‘to have your eyes upon ’‚ with wistful longing. So
apparently in Vei-g. Ecl. 111. 48 si ad vitulum spectas.

prostes ‘ be offered sor sale'‚ not without a double ementire.

Sosiorum, probably brothers, freedmen of the family of the
Sosii, possibly of the C. Sosius praetor in Rc. 49. They are
mentioned as booksellers also 111 A. P. 345. In the Greek
writers who mention C. Sosius (1 1111111611, Dio and Josephus) the
name is written with ωε if this 15 correct, and not due simply to
assimilation to Σωσιθεος and the like, we must assume syuizesis
of the z in both passages of Horace.

pumice: ‘after the volumen was completcd and rolled up,
both ends of the closed roll were smootlietl and polished with
pumice’ Munro Cmffltzczsmr of Camillus p. 54, against Elliss
