Catonis: the modernised form in which his only important
extant treatise De Re Rustica has corne down to us precludes us
from ascertaining in what way he enriched the Latin language.
Ennius did very much to fix the literary pronunciation of Latin,
and to determine its vocabulary.

59. producere nomen: Bentley on very slight authority read
procudere and (on none) nummum, which Ribbeck adopts as
necessary. But procudere is really tautologous after signatum.-
we need both ‘to coin’ and ‘to utter’ 3 and the metaphor being
sufficiently expressed in these words nomen is required for its
application. The metaphor of coinage applied to language is a
very common one: cp. Quint. Ι. 6, 3 utendum plane sermone ut
nummo, cui publica forma est.

i.e. by the growth of new leaves, while the earlier ones fall off
[or ‘parted from their leaves’ on the analogy of mmm-i civitate
(Aes. Salp. c. XX11.; Cic. Balb. 31), mittarifim'bus (Liv. V. 46,
1 1), mutari voluntate (Cic. ad Fam. V. 21, 1). In all these cases
the abl. is strictly 'one of respect, but the notion of severance comes
in. J. S. R.]. The silva corresponds to the aetas, thesolia to the
individual verba. Bentley printed silvis folia, supposing that saliri
could be lengthened before μα, which would be unparalleled in
Horace. The quotation in the grammarian Diomedes p. 394 Ρ. ut
solia in silvis is probably due only to a slip of memory, for it is
hard to see how it should have been altered into the reading of all
MSS. if genuine. He also ingeniously suggested privas sor pronos,
comparing Lucret. V. 274 privas multllm· in libras and 7 3 3 inque
dies privos, with the explanation of Paulus p. '226 M. privos pri-

priva dixerunt, quae nos singula dicimus. But in annos stands
very well by itself for ‘each year' as Carm. ΙΙ. 13, 14 in horas ε
⁶ every hour' z and there is 110 reason to ascribe an archaism to
Horace here. That Gellius supports his statement bya quotation
from Lucilius is, as Schiitz notices‚ an indication that he did not
find the word in Horace. Acron well explains pronos as declives
et cito labentes, instabiles, volubiles. Orelli rejects this explana-
tion, and interprets ‘ad finem vergentes’: but the birth of new
