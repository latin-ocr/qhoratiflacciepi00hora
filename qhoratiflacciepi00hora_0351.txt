standing the termination as an acc. plur. No other sorni but
Argis is found sor the dat. and abl.; the genitive does not occur:
the accusative Arg-os is usually masc. plur. (perhaps always in the
historians) as in Verg. Aen. 11. 95spalr1'0s ad Argos: but occa-
sionally neuter, as in Carm. 1. 7, 9 aptum dicit cquis Argos
(so in Ovid, but not in Verg.). Cp. Neue Ι2 477, 629.

130. sessor, ‘sitting regularly⁷. Cp. Juv. xlv. 86 (Mayor).

133. ignoscere servis: a reluctance to do this is treated as
a sign ofinsanity in Sat. Ι. 3, 80 ff.

134. signo lagoenae: wine flasks were always scaled up:
cp. Mart. IX. 87, 7 nunc szgrzmt meus anulus lczgroenam. Q.
Cicero tells Tiro (Cic. Ep. Fam. XVI. 26, 2) that his mother
used to secl up even the empty ones ne dicerentur inanes fizisse,
quae surlz'm essent exsiccatae. Lagocna and lagona are both
legitimate forms, but not lagena: the first has the best support
here, the second in Juvenal. Cp. Fleckeisen Ftc'aysszzg fla-tiled 20.

’ 135. rupem: Sat. 11. 3, 56—60; A. P. 459-

136. opibus, Orelli says would have been ope in prose. It
is doubtful whether even in verse the two can be thus inter-
changed. In Carni. 111. 3. 28 Hectoreis opibus is ‘by the might
of HR: in Ep. 1. ιο, 36 perhaps ‘resources’ is a better rendering
than ‘aid'. Cp. Cic. ad Att. lx. 16 Caesar z‘am opes meas, non
ut superioribus titteris, opem capessat.

137. expulit: cp. Catull. XLIV. 7 expuli (Ρ) tussim: Tibull. (?)
IV. 4, 1 Huc ades et tenerae morbos expelle puellae.

elleboro is much better established both sor Horace
and sor Vergil (Georg. 111. 451 Imm), than helleboro. Elle-
borus, for which the pure Latin word was veratrum (Lucret.
IV. 640, Pers. Ι. 51), though a poison if taken unduly, was a
savourite remedy sor insanity. The best grew at Anticyra:
cp. A. P. 300 (note). Sat. 11. 83 nescio an Anticyram ratio
illis [avaris] destinet omnem. Persius as usual overstrains the
expression ε Anticyras melior sorbere meracas.

bilemque: bile, especially when black (μέλαινα χολή), was
considered to cause frenzy oi· melancholy. Cp. Plaut. Amph.
720—1 atra bili percita est. Nulla res lam delirantis homines
concinnat cz'to,· Capt. 590 atra bilis cqgre'tat hominem: Cic. Tusc-
D. ΙΙΙ. 5, 11 quem nos furorem, μελαγχολίαν illi vocant. Sir
A. Grant on Ar. Eth. Nic. VH. 7, 8 rightly says ‘With the
moderns the term melam-lzoly is restricted to the cold aud
(lejected mood: while the ancients much more commonly applied
the term μελαγχολικός to denote warmth‚ passion, and eccen-
tricity of genius: cp. Ar. Probl. XI. 38 τὸ τῇ φαντασίᾳ ἀκολουθεῖν
ταχέως τὸ μελαγχολικὸν εἶναι ἐστίν’. Prior (Alma 210—11)
has the older sense of the word: ‘Just as the melancholic eye
