149. monstrata ‘prescribed’. Verg. Aen. 1v. 636 mon-
strata piacula: Georg. ιν. 549 monstratas aras: Juv. x. 363
monstro quod ipse tihi possis dare: Gronov. on Sen. de Ben. 1V.
28 medicina ctiam secleratis opem monstrat.

151. curm-ier ‘to be treated’, of course not ‘to be cured’ as
L. and S. render. In most of the cases to which they assign the
meaning ‘cure’, it is much better to translate ‘tend’ or ‘treat'.
Even in Liv. XXI. 8, 1 sometimes quoted as a clearinstance os the
meaning ‘cure' the other rendering is quite as legitimate. cor-
pora curare is Livy's regular phrase sor ‘to take food'. Cp.
Drakenborch on Liv. XXI. 54, 2.

audieras, from the talk of people in general, who are apt to
think that wealth means happiness: Ep. 1. 1, 53.

152. donarent: so all MSS. in accordance with the princi-
ple that even in stating a general truth‚ the tense of the verb on
which another depends determines the sequence. Cp. Cic. de
Off. 11. 1, 1 quenz ad modum cffcia ‹laceratam-ab lconcstate...salis
explicatum arbilror (with Holden's note). Roby ξ 1508. S. G.
§ 620. Hence Bentley's domu-inl, which he introduced by con-
jecture, adding ‘ita loquuntur qui pure scribunt’ is indesensible.

158. libra et aere. Gaius 1. 119 thus describes the process:
Est autam mancipatio...z'toezzzgrz'aeza212'a quaedam venditio: qnod ct
ipsum z'us proprium civium Romanorum cst ; caque res ila agiluf.
Adhibitae‘s non minus quam quinque testibus civibus Romanis pu-
beribus, et praeterea alio ciusdem condicionis qui llln'am aetnam
teneat, qui appellatur libripens, z's qui mancepio accipiat rem, aes
lenens ita dicit .· hunc ego hominem ex iure Quiritium meum esse
aio, isque mihi emptus est hoc aere aeneaque libra: deinde aere
percutit libram, idque aes dat ei a quo manczpio ancipit, quasi
prelii loco. The articles sold by mancipation were slaves, oxen,
horses‚ mules and asses, and landed property in Italy. The coin
or ingot was of bronze, because in the early days that metal was
alone used sor coinage: the balance was employed because all
money was originally weighed out by the purchaser (Gaius ib.
