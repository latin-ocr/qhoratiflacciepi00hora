80. niz—serves. Is you have been deceived and have intro·
duced a man who proves unworthy, do not attempt to stand by
him, in order that you may not exhaust your influence, but may
preserve it unimpaired for the protection of one whom you know
well, and who looks to you for help, when assailed by ealumny.
Bentley's conjectures at andfidcnter are quite superfluous.

82. dente Theonino: the scholiasts tell us that Theon was a
very witty and abusive sreedman, who so offended his patron by
his bitter jests that he was turned out of his house, and had a
sarthing lest to him that he might buy a rope and hang himself.
Nothing further is known of him, and even this is not very trust-
worthy.

circum-oditur: cp. Sat. 1. 4, 81 absentem qui rodit amicum.

ecquid sentis ⁴ do you feel at all?’ i.e. ‘ don't you feel?’
84. tua res agitur: cp. Juv. 111. 198—200.

86—95. lt is α hard tasse to retain the favour of tlte powmfitl,
foryon must alwayssczll z'n willa tlzcir hmnours.

87. metuet is perhaps a little better supported than metuit.

88. hoc age ‘give all your mind to it': Ep. Ι. 6, 31 (note),
Ter. And. 186, 415.

91. The spuriousness of this line does not admit ofa ques-
tion. It is not found in any of the good MSS.. and contains two
inexplicable difficulties: (1) bibulipotores is, as Bentley saw, little
better than potantes palbras, while to connect bibuli with Falerni
is to do reckless violence to the meaning of the word: (2) media
de nocte could only mean ‘as early as midnight⁷2 cp. Ep. 1. 2,
δὶς 14, 34. It is evident that some copyist (not before the xlth
century) feeling the need of a subject to oderunt introduced
potores and then attempted to make up the line by a clumsy
adaptation of Ep. Ι. 14, 34 quem bibulum liquidi media de luce
Falerni. The subject to oderunt may be derived from porrecta
pocula, i.e. porrigentes pocula. It unquestionably makes a neater
line to retain potores and omit oderunt, as is done by Meineke,
Haupt, L. Mulier, Kriiger and Schiitz. But Ι cannot see how
we can be justified in rejecting a word which is found in all
our good MSS. and retaining one which appears first in the
inferior ones. How are we to conceive of the history of the
line, if the true reading potores was ousted for centuries by ode-
runt, and then suddenly reappeared, bringing with it a spurious
ending to the line? It is quite astounding to find Macleane say-
ing in face of the evidence against it ‘the verse must remain till
a better can be found '. Any editor of the X1Xth century could
