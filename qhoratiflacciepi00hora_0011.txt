PREFACE.

THE need of a new edition of Horace's
Epistles with English notes will not be denied
by any one, who knows what important contri-
butions to the criticism of this work are still
inaccessible to English readers. The difficulty
of the task has made itself more and more felt
during every year which has been spent upon
the preparation of the present edition. Ι will
only say that, had not the excellent notes of
Mr Yonge been constructed on a different scale
from those here offered, or had there been any
hope of the early appearance of Mr Wickham‘s
long—promised second volume, the present work
would not have been undertaken.

The notes to the present edition may seem
to some too full and lengthy. For this fulness
there are three main reasons. (Ι) There are Latin
and Greek authors, whose works may properly
be provided with brief dogmatis: notes, suited to
studente, who are not ripe for critical discussions.
