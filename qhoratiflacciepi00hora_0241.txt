Bk. Ι. Ep. XVII] NOTES. 205

21. officium facio: ‘1 pay my court': sor qfficia in this sense
cp. Ep. 1. 7, 8 (note).

vilia, verum: this is the reading os the Scholiast, supported
by all MSS. of any critical vallic, and is rightly adopted by the
best moelem editors, as lxitter‚ Schiitz and Keller, Munro being
the only important exception. v'flea νι mm mig h’t be defended
by ficta rerum Sat. 11. 8, 83, vana rffum Sat.²³i1.2, 25, abdella
ntum A. P. 49, amam senarum Car1n.1v.12 ¹9 cto: cp.
Munro on Lucr.1. 315ffzmata ι”.ιιιηιη But on the other hand
Horace is fond of ending a line with? Ἠςιιιιη cp. Sat. 1. 2, 92,
Ep. Ι. 1, So, 11. 2, 70(where some MSS. have rernm as here,
against tlie sense), 106, A. P. 303: hence there is no reason sor
departing from the great preponderauce os authority. ‘lhe best
MSS. have simply demum some have zu ‘ram as, uhich is more
likely to be a grammatical correction, and this is a case uhere
the harder reading is to be pleserred. The construction appa-
rently' 15 ‘tu poscis vilia, verum poscis dante 1nin0r⁷‚i e. but in
making your demand >ou place >ourself' in a position of inse-
riority²> to the bestow ei.

22. fers ‘you boast’: Verg. Aen. V. 373 qm· se Bcbzycz'a
veniens de gcntcflrcbat.

nullius is masculine: neminis occurs in Plaut. Capt. 761
(Brix), but fell out of use before the time of Cicero.

23. color: ‘form of life': Sat. ΙΙ, Ι, 60 quisquis erit vilae
color.

24. temptantem ‘aiming at'. praesentibus aequum: cp.
Carm. 111. 29, 33 quod adest, memento componere aequus. prae-
sentibus appears to be the dative of the neuter plural, fequal to
the circumstances of the moment'3 although Klotz (Βία.) takes
it as amative, and some translators follow him, rendering ‘con-
tent with his present lot’. But is there any parallel to this use
of aeq uus? The commentators as a rule ignore the difficulty.
fere Ep. Ι. 6, 9 (note). Diog. Laert. ΙΙ. 8, 66, sa>s of Aristippus
ἦν mallos ἁρμοσασθαι Καὶ Τόπῳ Καί χρθνῳ Καὶ προσώπῳ Καί πᾶσαν
περίστασιν ἁρμοδίως ὑποκρίνασθαι· διὸ καὶ παρὰ Διονυσίῳ τῶν
ἄλλων εὐδοκίμει μᾶλλον ἀεὶ τὸ προσπεσὸν ευ διατιθέμενος.

25. duplici panno, the διπλοΐς of the Cynics, a large cloak
(abolla) also called τρίβων, worn doubled to serve at once as a
χιτών (tunica) and χλαμύς (pallium). Cp. Mayor on Juv. 111.
115 audi facinus maioris abollae: Diog. Laert. VI. 22 τρίβωνα
διπλώσας πρῶτος, κατά τινας διὰ τὸ ἀνάγκην ἔχειν καὶ ἐνεύδειν
αὐτῷ, πήραν τε ἐκομίσατο. Hence Diogenes is called by Cercidas
(Diog. Laert. Vl. 76) ὁ βακτροφόρας, διπλοείματος, αἰθεριβόσκας.
The words of Diog. Laert. make it plain that we must under—
stand duplz'cz' literally, not, as some have taken it, ‘coarsefi
