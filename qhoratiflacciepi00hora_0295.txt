Bk. ΙΙ. Ep. 1.] NOTES. ²59 -

Ιιαῖᾅγ phrases or lines must not lead us lo rcgara' a whole poem as
per ect.

63. est ubi: ἔστιν ὅτε, ‘ at times ’: hence peccat, not peccet,
which has very slight authority, is the right mood. Cp. Ep. Η.
⁴2, 182, Sat. 1. 4, 24, Roby§ 1687.

66. pleraque ‘ much '‚ not ¹ the greater part'; the meaning
here found is more common in later Latin than in Cicero, if
indeed it is found at all in his writings.

67. credit: Bentley fights hard sor cedit, -but admits that
credit may stand, and it is supported by all MSS. of any import-
ance.

68. meeum facit ‘supports my view ', Ep. Π. 2, ²3· Iove
aequo ‘with the favour os Heaven'‚ i.e. in his sound senses. Cp.
Sat. ΙΙ. 7, ¹4 iniquis Vatumnis, Π, 3, 8 dis iratis. Iniquus
meaning ‘unsavourable'‚ its opposite aequus comes to mean not
merely ‘impartial’ but ‘favour-able’: Verg. Aen. VI. 1²9 pauci
quos aequus amavit Ichpiler; and so osten.

69. delendave: —ve has much more authority here than
-que‚ and was rightly restored by Bentley. Sch'titz objects that
delenda esse reor does not disset sufficiently in meaning from
insector to make a disjunctive particle legitimate; hut the disser-
ence, though not great, is enough to admit of the disjunctive.

Livi: Bentley argued warmly against this reading. contending
that the works of Livius Andronicus were too antiquated and
rough sor any one to maintain that they were exactis minimum
distantia: hence he eagerly accepted the reading of some MSS„
including most of Keller’s first class, Lami. But Laevius, the
writer os ἐρωτοπαίγνια, was not at all fit to be placed in the
hands of school-boys: besides, he was probably a contemporary
of Cicero, and ‘attracted a certain interest only by his com-
plicated measures and affected phraseology’ (Mommsen, Hz'st.
IV. 589: cp. Teuffel, Rom. Lz't. ἓ 138, 5). The poems of Livius
not unnaturally took their place in a study of the development of
Roman literature.

70. plagosum: the word does not appear to be used else-
where in this active sense: it is found in Appuleius in the sense
of ‘much-beaten’. we may compare the use of nodosus, ap-
plied to a usurer in Sat. 11. 3, 69, to gout in Ep. 1. 1, 31, Ov.
Pont. 1. 3, ²3; but to a vine-stick in Juv. V111. 247· The
primary force of -osus ‘abounding in’ lends itself to either
usage.

¹11. orbilium, one of the masters at Rome, to whose lessons
Horace was taken by his father (Sat. 1. Ο, 76—82). According
to Suetonius (de Gramm. 9) he was a native of Beneventum

17—2
