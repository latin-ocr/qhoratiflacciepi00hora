352 Ales POETJCA.

81. populans strepitus, the murmur which always rises
from any large assembly, and drowns everything but the clearest
and most marked elocution. The frequent recurrence of the
ictus in iambic rhythm makes it sharper and more easily audible
than a metre which contains more short syllables. Cp. Cic. de
Orat. 111. 47, 182 (note).

82. natum rebus agendis ‘ suited by their nature to action'.
So Arist. Poet. XXIV. 10 τὸ δὲ ἰαμβικὸν καὶ τετράμετρον κινητικά,
τὸ μὲν ὀρχηστικὸν, τὸ δὲ πρακτικόν.

83. fidibus, dat. ‘to the lyre'. The object of dedit is
referre: cp. Roby S. G. ἓ 534, and v. 323 dedit—loqui. The
two main divisions of lyric (or more properly melz'c) poetry
were (1) the Dorian, or choric poetry, beginning with Terpander
of Lesbos, who flourished at Sparta ηε. 670—640, and in-
cluding Alcman, Thaletas‚ Arion, Stesichorus, Ibycus, and most
famous of all Simonides and Pindar: this was public, choral,
and elaborate in rhythm, and its subjects were religious or
national‚ including the glory of victors in the games: (2) the
Aeolic‚ of which Alcaeus, Sappho and Anacreon were the chief
representatives and in which personal emotions were expressed
in simplet metrical forms. To the former Horace refers in vv.
83, 84, to the latter in v. 85.

85. libera vina ‘the freedom of wine’, practically equivalent
to ‘the wine which frees men’ from their cares (Ep. 1. 5, 16 f.);
or else, as Orelli takes it, of the free speech of those who have
drunk much wine (cp. Sat. Ι. 4, 89; 11. 8, 37).

86—118. Not only must the right diction (45—72) and the
fitting metre (73ὴ86) be chosen, but also the proper tone and
style must be maintained. Horace here begins to deal especially
with dramatic poetry, which he keeps in view almost exclusively
up to v. ²94· One wlzo cannot keep up tlte right tone in treatz‘ng

86. descriptas ‘marked out’ ‚assigned to tragedy and comedy
respectively. Biicheler would read here against all MSS. dz's-
crz'plas ‘apportioned’. For the difference between the words
cp. Cic. de Sen. τε, 5; and 17, 59 with Reid's notes.

vices seems never to mean ‘parts’, the translation osten
given to it here. Comparing Carm.1v. 7, 3 mutat term vice·
we see that vzces may denote the states into which a thing passes
by change, as well as the changes themselves. Here it is ‘the
differences’. operumque colores is added to explain vices: cp.
