Bk. 11. Ep.1.] NOTES. 289

’ a curious story (V. H. lv. 4), ‘I hear that there is a law at
Thebes enjoining all artists‚ and painters, and sculptors, to
improve upon their subjects in representing them. The law
threatens with a penalty those who in sculpture or painting
represent them as uglier than they are' (τοῖς εἰς τὸ χεῖρόν ποτε ἢ
πλάσασιν ἢ γράψασι). There is of course no reference here to
intentional caricature.

265. proponi cereus ‘to be exposed as a waxen image’:
i.e. to have a caricatured portrait of myself offered sor sale. It
was customary to make the imagines of deceased ancestors of
wax (Plin. H. N. xxxx. 2, 6 caym-essi cetu voltus singulis dis-
ponebantur armarz'is); and the art may naturally have been
transferred to living persons of celebrity. Sometimes these were
made by means of a plaster cast taken from the sace of the
subject. Cp. Marquardt lelius. Privatalt. Ι. 246. There is a
very life-like wax mask to be seen in the Museum at Naples
(Mus. Borbon. XV. 54) which was found in a tomb at Cumae:
it still has traces of paint upon the face. Cp. Daremberg
and Saglio‘s Diet. fig. 1291.

267. pingui ‘stupid‘: Sat. 11. 6, 14.

una cum scriptore meo: Horace does not seem to mean
more than ‘1 should be involved in the disgrace which will
come upon the poet who makes me his theme, when his worth-
less poem is sent'osf to be used for waste paper’. The sug-
gestion that he may mean ‘bust and poem alike would be
discarded as rubbish’ does not seem so good.

268. capsa, properly 'a book—case (Sat. Ι. 4, 22), here hu-
morously put fora bier.

porrectus, stretched out at length like a corpse. operta is
the reading of all MSS. of any importance, and may well be
defended. Sometimes a corpse was carried out to burial on an
open coueh or bier (lectus, feretrum), sometimes in a coffin
(capulus) carried on a frame (sandapila), cp. Marquardt Privat-
alt. 1. 360; and the latter was the more usual with the poorer
classes; Becker, Gallus³ ΙΙΙ. 364. Many recent editors prefer
aperta, which Orelli thinks denotes more contempt: but the
reverse is the case, if we are to accept the analogy of funerals.

269. vicum, probably the vicus Tuscus of Sat. ΙΙ. 3, 228.

270. quicquid: Pers. Ι. 43 adds mackerel: nec scombros
metuentia carmina nec tus ; which he gets from Catull. xcv. 7
Volusi anuales...laxas scombris saepe dabunt tunicas. Oui·
modern equivalent is to be found in the trunk-makers and
pastry-cooks. Cp. Martial VI. 60, 7 Quam mulli tineas pascunt
blattasque diserti, et redimunt soli carmina docta coqui, 111. 2, 4
ne...tur2‘s piperisque sis cucullus.
