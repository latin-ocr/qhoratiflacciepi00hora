28. dixtt has no authority worth considering. duxit was
unquestionably the reading of the archetype. On the other hand
collegam dicere is the regular technical term for the ‘ nomination '
os a consul aster his election by a colleague who for any reason
had been previously elected (cp. Mommsen Ram. Staatsr. 1².
209). The question then arises whether it is more probable that
Horace should have employed a phrase nowhere else found,
and extremely hard to explain by the usage of the language, or
that an error of one slight stroke should have crept into the
archetype. When we consider passages like Epod. 1, 15; 4, 8;
Sat. Ι. 6, ιοες 10, 863 Epist. Ι. 5, 28; 7, 96, to take only cases
where the archetype was unquestionably corrupt, we cannot, I
think, hesitate which way we should decide. Porph. explains
duxit by sortitus est ‘quia sortem duci dicimus ⁷ : but there was
no question of the lot in the electiori of consuls. Ritter not
much rnore happily says ‘respicit eiusmodi munera, ad quae
agenda simul piogressi sunt consules, ut alter ab altero duce-
retur'. Obbarius explains ‘took as his companionss a meaning
found only where there is some reference to a journey. Orelli
says ‘ veluti praecedens Lollius post se quasi comitem aliquanto
tardiorem duxit Lepidum. Macleane calls this‘ sar· setched',
but has nothing to suggest. Some have even compared uxm em
ducere l For the circumstances cp. Introduction.
