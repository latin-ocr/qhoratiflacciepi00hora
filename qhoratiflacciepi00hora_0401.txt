near the ssute—player‚ to sing the cantica, while the actor accom-
panied him with appropriate gestures. —N ow Bentleyassumed that
the cantor was the flute-player, and that ‘cantoris erat depositis
ex ore tibiis plaudite insonare’. Hermann on the other hand
Opusc. 1. 302) argues that the cantor and the liistrzb were one
and the same, quoting Cic. de Sen. 19, 70 neque enim histrioni,
utplaceat, peragenda sabula est, modo in quocumque fitcrit actu
probetur ,· neque sapientibus usqne ad ‘plaudite’ vestiendum est: and
Quintil. Vl. 1, 52 tunc est commovendum theatrum cum vetitum
est ad {fisum illud, qno veteres tragoediae comoediaeque cliidmilur,
plodite. The passage in Cic. only means that a good actor
need not be vexed, if he has to leave the stage before applause
is formally challenged, by himself or some one else: the
passage in Quintil. says nothing on the present point. 1
believe that the cantor was neither the ssute-player, nor an
ordinary actor, but the singer to whom the cantica had been
committed throughout. The usual books of reference are not
clear on this point. That cantor may mean ‘actor’ simply has
been argued from Cic. p. Sest. 5 5, 118 nam cum ageretur togala,

immittens contionata est...Scd<·l1at exanimalns; ct is, qui aulea
cantorum convicio contiones celebrare sitas solebat, canlorum ip-

Gesclz. 111. 307, after speaking of the professional dcmagogues,
and their paid applauders, goes on to say: ‘the well-trained
throats (Gm‘gelnsof the staff of the theatres were a coveted
article for these standing thunderings' (a passage oddly mis-
translated by Dr Dickson, E. T. iv. 295, and by Dr Holden
ad loc.); and this, he says, is the meaning of the passage in
Cicero. He had been accustomed to hire strong voices from
the theatre to applaud him: now these voices were used to turn
him into ridicule. But the narrative is too obscure sor us to be
able to determine what kind of cantores these were, and how they
came to be all singing together in a comoedia togata. Ι find no
other passage in which cantorappears to mean ‘actor’ : Suet. Calig.
LVII. is certainly not one. Cp. note on Cic. de Orat. 1. 60, 244.

157. naturis: so all MSS. Bentley's malm-is has found some
favour3 it gives at first sight an excellent antithesis to mobilibus,
while naturae are not happily described as mobiles (cp. Ep. Ι. 10,
24), and the trajection of etis quite in Horace's way. But after
all maturus does not afford the best contrast to mobilis: and

mobilibus naturis et annis may be taken as a hendiadys ‘natures
that change with years'.

158. reddere voces ‘reply in words’, not ‘repeat words'
(as Or. and Schtitz) heard from the mother or the nurse: cp.
Verg. Aen. 1. 409 veras andire et reddere voces, and Catuli.
inv. 166 nec missas andire queunt nec reddere voces.
