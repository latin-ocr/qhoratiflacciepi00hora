BOOK I. EPISTLE I.

MAECENAS, as is plain srorn the opening words of this
Epistle‚ had urged Horace to resume the composition of lyric
verse. If any special occasion sor this advice is to be sought,
it may probably be found in the journey of Augustus to the East
in B.C. 21, followed by the expedition of Tiberius to Armenia,
and the restoration of the Roman standards taken by Crassus
(cp, Ep. X11. 26). It would have been natural for Maecenas
to wish that his friend andproltfgrdshould not lose the opportunity
thus supplied sor a panegyric on the Emperor and his policy.
Horace here expresses the reasons which had led him to devote
himself for the future rather to the study of philos0phy; (lifsering
from the mass of mankind who value wealth above virtue, he
declares that it is only in the pursuit of the latter that true
happiness is to be found.
