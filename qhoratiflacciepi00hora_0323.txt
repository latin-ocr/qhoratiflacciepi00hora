show whether he was alive or not at this time. Horace praises
his epic poetry (Sat. 1. ιο, 44); but his most famous work was
his tragedy of Thyestes, which Quintilian (x. ι, 98) ranks with
the Greek master-pieces.

multa dantis cum laude: i.e. all men warmly praise such
judicious liberality‚ instead of laughing at it, as in the case of
Alexander and Choerilus. Ritter oddly thinks that the words
refer to the lively gratitudo of the recipients.

24⁷. Vergilius: cp. Palmer on Sat. I. 5, 40 ‘the weight of
MSS. and scholiasts of Horace here and elsewhere is mosily on
the side of Virgilius: but these cannot bc set against the
Medicean and other early MSS. of virgil: see Wagner Ortlzogr.
Verg. p. 479³. Add Ritschl Opusc. ii. 779 ss.

248. expressi ‘reproduced': the metaphor is taken srom
plastic figures in clay or wax, and then becomes more general,
and is used of imitation generally: cp. Cic. de Orat. 111. 12, 47
vitia imitatione ex aliquo expressa.- pro Arch. 6, 14 mullas uobis
imagines fortissimorum virorum expressas scriptores Gracci cl
Latini reliquerunt.

aenea: both in Vergil and in Horace much better established
than ahenea, which, as Mommsen has shewn (Hermes Ι. 467), is
not found in inscriptions to denote the bronze tablet used as a
military diploma, before A.D. 134.

as well as myseif.

250. semones here includes both Satires and Epistles‚ not
merely the former, as Acron says. The style of the Epistles,
though somewhat more careful than that of the Satires, is essen-
tially the sermo quotidianus ,· cp. Palmer's Prcyizce lo tlte Satires
p. XXIII. and ad Her. 111. 13, 23 sermo esc oratio remissa et
finitima quotidianae locutioni. Conington renders:

Nor is it choice (ah, would that choice were alli)
Makes my dull Muse in prose-like numbers crawl.

So in Sat. Π. 6, 17 Horace speaks of his musa pedeslris. Pro-
pertius 11. 1, 17—42 similarly ascribes his love-poetry to his
incapacity for lostier strains.

251. res componere gestas, i.e. to write a histor1cal epic
poem.

252. arces montibus impositas, stormed by the Roman
armies: ep. Carm. IV. 14, 11 arces Alpibus impositas.

253. tuis auspiciis: Augustus srom ΒΕ. 23 onwards held a
