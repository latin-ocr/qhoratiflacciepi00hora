(note), 111. 31, 12 5 rerum enim copia verborum copiam gzssgnit:
Cato’s rule rem tene, verba sequentur ,· and the saying of Asinius
Pollio, quoted here by Porphyrion male hercle eveniat verbis
nisi rem sequantur. Acron reminds us how Menander used to
say that he had finishcd a play as soon as he had settled the
plot, even if he had not written a linc.

312. quid debeat, ‘his duties towards‘ etc. not, of course,
with any special reference to himself, but generally what duties
are owed by rnen. Hence it is necdlcss with Peerlkamp to
change the second quid into quis.

314. conscripti, ‘a senator '. Paul. D. p. 41 M. conscripti
dicebantur, qui ex equestri ordine patribus adscribebantur, ut
numerus senatorum expleretur. Livy, 11. 1, 10 says deinde
[senatus]...patrum numerum primoribus equestris gradus lectis
ad ccc summam explevit, traditmnqne inde fictur, nt in senatum
vocarentur, qni patres quique conscripti essent: conso-eptas, vide-
licet novum in senatum, appellabant lectos. Festus, p. 2 54 M.
says that 164 plebeians were thus added to the senate. Ac-
cording to this story, which has been generally accepted, the
familiar phrase patres conscripti is for patres et conscripti. Itis
quite clear that Livy and Festus are in error in supposing the
newly added senators to have been plebeians: it is absurd to
suppose that at a time when the plebeians were admitted to no
magistracy, they should have constituted a majority of the
governing council (cp. Madvig Vctf u. Vcrw. 1. 125, Herzog
Gesclz. α’. R. Staatsv. Ι. 130). But it is further probable that,
in spite of the credence given to it by some of the best autho-
rities, e.g. Becker, Mommsen, Lange, and Madvig, the story,
and with it the current explanation of the phrase patres conscripti,
is to be rejected altogether. Conscrzpti is a very doubtful equi-
valent for adlecti, and that patres meant the patrician senators
alone cannot be regarded as established, in spite of Mommsen’s
arguments in Rossm Forsclz.1. 218 1f. Hence lhne Rom. Gcsclz.
Ι. 116 [E. T.137—8] and XVillems, Le St. nat Ι. 38-63, Dtozt
Romam pp.1S7—9 maintain that palm s conscrlpti means simply
‘the tathers (patricians) who are on the roll'. Thus we can
understand Cic. Phil. XIII. 13, 28 mntavzt calceos, pater con-
scriptus factus est. C onscriptns alone occurs only here. The
strongest argument for the current view is drawn from the
quotation in Festus, p. 254 ‘qni patres qui conscrzpli’ vocati
sunt in curiam, which Mommsen, A'b'zn. Forsclz. Ι. 254 (note)
regards as reproducing the formal summons of the herald in the
torum.
