2. spectatum ‘approved’z the technical term, stamped on
the tessera (prize medal) which a gladiator received, after dis-
tinguishing himself in the arena. A large number of these
tesserae have been discovered: ‘Ex osse eboreve sunt omnes,
exiguae molis, ansatae et ad gestandum appendendumve aptae,
formae longiusculae quadratae excepta unica recentissima sex
laterum. Singulis lateribus singuli versus inscripti sunt, ut a quo
incipias arbitrarium sit.’ Mommsen Corp. Inscr. Lat. Ι. p. 195.
Mommsen was inclined, for various reasons, to doubt the current
opinion that these were presented at the close of a successful
fight, but there is some fresh support for this view in the recent
discoveiy of a bronze tablet recording a presentation probably of
this kind: cp. Corp. ΙΙ. 4963, (where it is figured), NVilmanns
Ex. Inscr. Lat. 11. p. 239. Ritschl has discussed the tesserae
very fully and supported the old view in Opusc. IV. 572 ff.
Cp. Friedl'ander Sitteng. 113 510. It is to be noticed that Some
have the word spectavit (never spectatus) in full t of these six are
now known to exist (cp. Ephem. Epigr. 111. 161, ‘²033 Garrucci
Syll. p. 651 and Tav. 11. 7). Mommsen thinks that spectavit may
mean ‘took his place as a spectator‚’ no longer in the arena.
