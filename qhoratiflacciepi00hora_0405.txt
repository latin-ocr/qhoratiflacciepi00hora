happy lise’. [Orelli's τὰ παρακείμενα has no classical authority,
though often used in text-books of logic.]

Apta indicates that the connexion denoted by adiuuem is a
natural one. The transposition (lszcrbaton) of -que is common
enough in Horace, e.g. Sat. 1. 6, 44 cornua quod vimatque tubas.
11. 3, 130, etc.: aevum is used sor ‘time of lise‘ in Ep. Ι. 20, 26
and in Verg. G. 111. 100 animos aevumque notabis, as elsewhere:
morari may well be used sor ‘to dwell with care upon’. Hence
none of Ribbeck's reasons sor rejecting this line has any cogent
force. There is a good deal of authority here sor morabitur.- but
it is so awkward to supply scriptor, that we must regard this
reading as simply an over-sight, perhaps (lue to agitur.

1⁷9—188. lez'ngs seen on tlze stage impress the audietne,
more than things reported: but there are some scencs not fit lo
be represented in action.

179. in scaenis: the plural, used also in Verg. Aen. Ι. 429,
lv. 471 scaenis agitatus Orestes, seems to refer to the various
occasions on which a play would be acted ; ‘in theatres' : it is
apparently never used of a single stage. The form scenis is
quite indefensible: cp. Ribbeck Prol. Verg. p. 387. Corssen

180. segnius: cp. Cic. de Orat. ΙΙΙ. 41, 163 fizcillus ad ea,
quae visa, quam ad illa quae audita sunt, menta& oculi feruntur:
and more sully in 11. 87, 357. Peerlkamp would transpose
demissa and subiecta, quoting several passages in which denn'ttere
is used for ‘rem alte in animum mittere '‚ or subicere for ‘leviter
suggerere’. But these meanings do not necessarily attach to
the words, and there is no objection to saying ‘things which
pass into the mind through the ears', or ‘which are brought
before the eyes ’. For subiecta=fi⁷roxemeva cp. Reid on Acad.

181. fidelibus: cp. Herod. Ι. 8 ὦτα ’γὰρ τυγχάνει ἀνθρώ-

182. ipse tradit: ‘ipse mihi trado quod vide03 at alter
mihi tradit quod narrat’. Acron.

183. digna gen: Sat. 1. 3, 24 degrnusque notam· (with

184. facundia praesens ‘the eloquence of one who is now
onthe stage’: this is better than to take it of one who witnessed
