Bk. II. Ep. L] NOTES. 255

50—54. There is a convcntional style of laudalion of our older
poets now current, which secures them general appromzl.

50. Ennius is calledsortz’s mainly because of the brave spirit
in which he sung of the battles of Rome. Cp. Ep. 1. 19, 7. At
the same time he served with distinction among the Messapian
allies of Rome in the second Punic War. Pros. Sellar in his ad-
mirable study of Ennius says: ‘ This actual service in a great war
lest its impress on the work done by Ennius. Fragments both of
his tragedies and his Annals prove how thoroughly he understood
and appreciated the best qualities of the soldierly character.
This sellowship in hardship and danger fitted him to become the
national poet of a race of soldiers’ (Roman l'oets, p. 67). But
to compare him with Homer is to put him to a test which he
cannot be expected to stand : ib. p. 102. ’

51. lenter curare=securus esse Porph. Bentley, with
his usual masterly insight, saw that Porph. had hit the mark by
interpreting: ‘ Ennius is now sure of his harvest of same, about
which he had previously been anxious, and so cares little for the
promises of his Pythagorean dreams'. Horace is here setting
forth the high reputation which the older poets were enjoying in
his own day, not criticising them from his own point of view, and
censuring Ennius for carelessness, as some editors have wrongly
supposed—Bergk has shewn that Horace probably takes Varro
as his type of the critici, several of the judgments here passed
closely agreeing with those of Varro in various works.

somnia: Cic. Acad. 11. 16, 51 (Ennius) cum somniavit, ita
narravit ‘visus Homerus adesse poeta'. This was at the begin-
ning of his Annals, as we learn from the scholiast on Pers. VI. ιο
cor iubet lzoc Enni, postquam destertuit esse Illaeonides Quintus
pavone ex Pythagorea, rendered by Conington ‘ so says Ennius'
brain. when he had been roused from drearning himself Maeo-
nides Quintus developed out of Pythagoras⁷ peacock'. The
scholiast explains this by saying that the soul of Ennius had
passed through five stages, a peaeock, Euphorbus (cp. Carm. 1.
28, 10), Homer, Pythagoras, Ennius3 and Porphyrion here says
‘in principio Annalium suorum somnis se scripsit admonitum,
quod secundum Pythagorae dogma anima Homeri in suum corpus
venisset) I cannot find any authority, except in this passage,
for the statement that Homer’s soul passed into Ennius : certainly
Cicero (Le.) says nothing about it, as Conington’s note on Pers.
Prol. 3 asserts; and in Lucret. 1. 116—126 we have simply the
statement that Ennius taught the doctrine of metempsychosis,
and that Homer appeared to him ‘ pouring out briny tears’, and
,revealed to him the nature os the universe, a vision which ΜΓ
Sellar thinks evidently suggested the dream in which Hector
