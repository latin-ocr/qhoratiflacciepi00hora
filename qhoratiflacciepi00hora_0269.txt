is more common in this sense.

26. brevioribus ‘ humbler' οι· ‘ scantier’, not, as some have
taken it, ‘less enduring’‚ til-e breve lilium (Carm.1. 36‚16),
nzmz'um btev es stores ann nae roste (ib. 11. 3, ‚¹4)' Horace· is
arguing in desence of his onn originality.1t is true, he sayS,
that I imitated the meires of Archilochus: but so did Sappho
and Alcaeus, and no one accuses them of plag iaiism, sor their
themes and st) le are altogether uiuerent: and so are mine.
Bentley in one of his most convincing notes first brought out
clearly the connexion and interpretation of this passage, which
had very commonly been misunderstood. Even now Ritter sup-
poses that Horace draws a distinction between his Epodes and

his Odes: but this ruins the sequence of the thought. xie—ornes

27. artem, ‘ technique.’

28. temperat-sappho. ‘masculine Sappho moulds her
Muse by the measure of Archilochus' :lempmwe is the regular
word for giving artistic shape to a composi: ion, especially of
music: cp. Prop. 11. 34 (z 111. 36), 80: laleftczs cmm n, docta

pede is not ‘foot’ but‘ measure' , denoting the whole line, as in
Carm. IV. 6, 35 Lesbium servate pedem .’ Α. Ρ. 81.

mascula is a term of praise‚ not of blame, as the Scholiasts
strangely suppose.

29. ordine, best understood with Bentley of the arrangement
of the various lines used by Archilochus in a strophe. e.g. the
Archilochus mmor (a7l707 ibasque comae) was coupled by Alcaeus
with a dactylic hexameter (Hor. Od.1V. 7,) by Archilochus him-
self with an iambic trimeter (F rag 104).

30. nee-quaerit. The difference between Alcaeus, at any
rate, and Archilochus as to their themes was hardly so great as
we might imagine from these passages. Alcaeus seems to have
attacked Pittacus with no less bitterness than Archilochus showed
to Lycambes, though on political as much as on personal grounds.
We can discover also ⁴ the same enjoyment of love and wine, ot
rambling about the world, and of adventure' (Mahaffy, Greek
Lz’terature Ι. p. 181). Sappho's poetry on the other hand was
almost entirely confined to the passion of love. atris: cp.
