xxii INTRODUCTIOM

can form a clear conception of the standard generally
reached from the numerous letters of Cicero's friends,
included in the Epistolae ad Familiares. The literary
finish of many of them is such that it would have
been no very great step to take, even without pre-
cedent, for Horace to give a metrical form to such
occasional letters of daily life as Ep. i. 8, 9 or 13.

The name of sermones given by Horace himself
to the Epistles (Ep. ii. 1, 250) as well as to the Satires
(Ep. i. 4, 1) fitly describes the conversational tone
maintained throughout. Here too his style and
thoughts are sermoni propiora (Sat. i. 4, 42). The
various epistles differ of course very widely in the
degree of elaboration, as in the nature of their
themes. But everywhere we find a complete absence
of rhetoric. Horace’s horror of public recitations did
him good service in preserving him from the faults
into which the practice led most of his contemporaries
and foHowers, with results fatal to the freshnessand

and finish there is no Latin poet worthy to be placed
beside him, and he well deserves the place which he
has ever held close to the exemplaria Graeca, which
he studied so lovingly.

His rhythm and metre fitly answer to the general
tone of his work. Less cunning and subtle in their
