busied themselves much with the character of Iccius. It is
evident that he was not as well satisfied with his post as Horace
thought that he ought to have been ε but apparently only because
he would gladly have had more time for philosophy. There is
nothing to stamp him as either miser or misanthrope. Pompeius
Grosphus, whom Horace here introduces to his friend, was a
rich Sicilian knight (Carni. 11. 16, 33—36): it is a plausible
conjecture that he was the son or grandson of a Sicilian Greek
Eubulidas, surnamed Grosphus, of high character and great
wealth (Cic. in Verr. ΙΙ. 3, 23, 56), who may have received the
franchise through Cn. Pompeius, and so have ta] en his name.
