90 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

Janus, from the top to the bottom '. We may notice however a
passage in Livy XLI . 27 et formu porticibus tabernisque clauden-
dum et lanas t1¹es faciendos, which somewhat supports Becker's
theory: the name of the town in question is lost, the passage
being much mutilated3 but it is possible that the constructions
described were in imitation of those at Rome: they were cer-
tainly not at Rome, as Mr King (on Phil. VI. 5) supposes. For
t'ne phrase summus ab imo: ‘from the top to the bottom ’, cp.
Ovid Ib. 181 Iugeribusque novem qui [Tityos] summus distat ab
zmo.

55. prodocet z ‘ palam docet' ‘holds sorth‚’ or perhaps rather
‘ docendo praeit ²: the word is only found here; in προδιδάσκειν
the preposition sometimes seems to retain very little force;
perdocet retained by Macleane has extremely little authority, not
being found in any good MS.

56. laevo...1acerto, a line repeated from Sat. 1. 6, 74 and
rejected by many recent editors. But it is found in all MSS„
and may perhaps be defended as heightening the irony ι old and
young all repeat the same Iesson‚ like a pack of school-boys, on
their way to sch001.—-suspens·1 loculos, Roby§ 1126, S. G.§ 471.

57, 58. These two lines are inverted in the earlier editions,
and in most good MSS. The usual order is due to Cruquius,
and is warmly defended by Bentley, whose authority has pre-
vailed with most recent editors. Ι feel by no means ‘sure that
Ritter is not right in preferring the other order, which is sar
better established, and which gives a Horatian abruptness. The
reading si sor scd is weakly supported; so is Bentley's desint for
desunt.

57. est, cp. 1. 33. lingua ‘a ready tongue’. fides either
‘ credit ⁵, that is, a respectable position in money matters, though
not quite up to the standard sor a knigh't (cp. Ep. 1. 6, 36),
or perhaps better ‘loyalty' to your friends, to be connected
closely with lingua, and hence not, as Orelli thinks, tautologous
aster mores.

58. quadringentis, sc. milibus sestertium, to the 400,000 ses-
terces fixed as the rating of the equites by the lex iudiciaria of C.
Gracchus. There was a census equester from the earliest times
(Liv. v. 7), but its amount is a matter of conjecture only (Becker
R. A. 11. 1, 250).

sex septem: for the asyndeton cp. Ter. Eun. 331 his mensi-
bus sex septem. Cic. ad Att. X, 8, 6 sex septem diebus. It does
not seem to occur with any other numerals3 but cp. ter quater.

59. plebs, not in its legal sense, but in the general mean-
ing a ‘low fellow.' So Hom. Il. ΧΠ. ²13 δῆμον ἐόντα, on
which Hesych. comments δημότην, καὶ ἕνα τῶν πολλῶν; cp. Sat. 1.
