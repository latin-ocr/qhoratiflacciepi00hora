382 ARS POETsCA.

to have written any comedies‚ it is probable that, with Orelli,

we should substitute the name of Caecilius. Cp. Ribbeck Com.
Lat. Frag. p. 81.

emuncto, a coarse expression, chosen intentionally to illus-
trate the style too low for the satyric drama: ‘ chiselled ’.
Terence once (Phorm. 682 cmunxz' augente senes) puts it into the
mouth of a slave, Plautus has the phrase more frequently: cp.
Epid. 494 qui me emunxisti mucidum minumi preti .· Most. 1108
Th. dedisti verba. Tr. qui tandem? Th. probe med emunxti.
Cruquius took the metaphor to be one of ‘milking’, but the
context in the last passage, and the use of the Greek ἀπομύττειν
(cp. Menand. Fragm. 482 ’γέρων ἀπεμέμυκτ’ ἅθλιος) make it clear
that this is not the case. Bentley's emendation. according to which
this word is read in Caecilius ap. Cic. Lael. 26, 99, is not to be
accepted, as eg. in Long's text.

Simone, a rich old man, probably the master of Pythias.

239. Silenus, the oldest of the satyrs‚ and their leader
(cp. Eur. Cyclops), though riotous and fond os wine, was yet
always represented as full os knowledge and wisdotn, so that
Vergil can not unsuitably put into his mouth a philosophica}
exposition of the origin of the universe and the early history of
man (Ecl. VI. 31 sf.). Siniilarly when captured by Midas he is
said to have taught him prosound se'erets as to the nature of
things and the future. Cp. Cic. Tusc. Ι. 48, 1143 and Diod. Sic.
IV. 4 φασὶ δὲ καὶ παιδαγωγὸν καὶ τροφέα συνέπεσθαι κατὰ τὰς
στρατείας αὐτῷ [Διονύσῳ] Σειληνόν, εἰσηγητήν καὶ διδάσκαλον
γινόμενον τῶν καλλίστων ἐπιτηδευμάτων, καὶ μεγάλα συμβάλ-
λεσθαι τῷ Διονύσῳ πρὸς ἀρετήν τε καὶ δόξαν. Evidently it was
not proper to put into his mouth the language of a low and
knavish slave.

240. ex noto fictum carmen sequar. Horace has been -

speaking hitherto only of the language of the satyric drama, and
to this he returns in v. 244: hence most editors explain carmen
as genus dicendi ‘a style of verse', desending this meaning by
carminibus in v. 90. Then fictum is ‘artistically composed'‚
and cx nolo ‘out of familiar materials'. Schiitz doubts whether
carmen ean fairly bear this meaning, and holds that the scholiasts
are right in taking it to reser to the substance of the poem. In
that case the verses must bc out of place here τ they must either
be transposed to after v. 250, or else (as Schiitz suggests) find a
place somewhere in the passage vv. 125—x35, or be rejected
altogether with Ribbeck. They are too good in themselves sor
us readily to accept the last alternative, and carmen may, Ι
think, fairly reser to the style.

sequar ‘1 will aim at': Ep. 11. 2, ¹43·
