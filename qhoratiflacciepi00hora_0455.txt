NOTES. 419

467. idem occidenti: cp. Lucret. 111. 1038 eadem aliis
sopitu' quietest (Homerus), lv. 1174 cadem sacz‘t...0mnia turpi
‘she does, in all things, the same as the ugly woman‘, Roby
ἓ 1142. Seneca Phoen. 100 occidere est velare cupientem morl, an
exaggerated imitation, for Horace only means that in each case
violence is done to the wishes of the person concerned. This is
the only spondaie hexameter in Horace.

468. iam ‘at once’ with flet.
469. famosae ‘notorious’; Ep. 1. 19, 32. .

470. our, i.e. what sin he has committed, in consequence os
which the gods have sent upon him this srenzy.

471. bidental: when a place was struck with lightning, it
was the custom condere fulmen, with a sacrifice of sheep (bidentes),
and to enclose the spot with a wall. Another derivation quod
bis fulmine percussum est is evidently wrong, though Acron
prefers it. Cp. Pers. 11. 27 evitandumque bidental with the
scholiast's note, and Juv. VI. 587.

473. valuit, common in poetry for potuit ⁴ has succeeded in
bursting’. Roby§ 1454, S. G. ἓ 591, 2.

clatros, the only form justified by MSS. and inscriptions.
The word is an early derivative from κλῇθρα (used by Cato
R. R. 4), and hence follows the rule sor Latin words. Cp.
Cic. Or. 48, 160, with Sandys’ note, and Roby§ ¹32·

476. non missura...hi.rudo ‘like a leech‚ which will not let
ἰῶ t1 tlZe {mile passes into a metaphor, as often in Horace : cp.
