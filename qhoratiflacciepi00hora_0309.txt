defluxit ‘passed out of use ’. grave virus ‘the noisome
venom’: virus is any offensive fluid; the word is sometimes
used metaphorically, as in Cic. Lael. 23, 87 apud quem evomet
virus acerbitatis suae: sometimes it means simply ‘steuch’, as
in Lucret. 11. 853, and perhaps in VI. 805.

159. munditiae ‘ elegance ’. The verse and diction of
Ennius, though rough in themselves, were polished as compared
with the poetry of Livius and Naevius.

and the Atellan plays.

161. serus refers to fi’rus victor, i.e. the Romans. Ritter
thinks that the sense requires that this should refer to some
individual writer who came comparatively late in the line of
Roman poets, and taking Punica bella to include the Third, finds
this writer in Accius, who in his LibriDidascalion seems to have
made a learned study of the Greek tragedians, as well as his
Latin predecessors (Teuffel, Rom. Lz't. ς’ 119, 7). The lines 165
—167 apply sufficiently well to Accius, but temptavit rem cannot
surely be referred to any individual, except to the first who
wrote tragedies in Latin. It is better therefore to regard the
whole passage as denoting the general characteristics of the
Roman dramatistsi serus will then mean ‘late in the history of
the city'. [lt is almost impossible to believe that vv. 166-7
were not written with reference to some person. Ennius,
Pacuvius or Accius must have been taken as a specimen of
the Roman tragic writers, just as Plautus is taken as a specimen
of the comic writers. The words serus enim etc. apply very
well to Ennius, who was probably not free from military service
till after he was 35 years of age. The sense of tmptavit rem is
strictly limited by dzgne: the person (whoever he be) tried
whether he might not worthily render what had before been
rendered unwortln‘ly. I cannot think the text right as it
stands. J. S. R.] Perhaps chartis disguises some corruption.

here included, as of less importance than the other two. Aulus
