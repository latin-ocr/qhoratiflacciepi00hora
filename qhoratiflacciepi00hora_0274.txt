238 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

aridaque morsu pumicis aridi politus. Macleane is wrong here
first in speaking of parchment rolls, instead of papyrus, and
secondly in supposing that the outside skin was polished with
pumice: the parchment (membrana) used as the wrapper of the
papyrus roll was stained purple or saffron. Tibull. 111. 1, ι)
lutea sed niveum involvat membrana libellum, pumex et canas
tondeat ante comas.

3. claves: books not offered sor sale were kept in locked
and sometimes sealed cases (scm'm'a) or ehests (armarii), usually
of cedar to keep off moths. Cp. Mart. Ι. 66, 5—8 secreta quaere
carmina et mdes curas quas novit unus scrinioque signatas cns-
todit ipse vz'ygz'nz's pater chartae, quae trita duro non inhorruit
mento, where an unpublished poem is compared to a young girl,
as here to a boy. Menander speaks of keeping a wife not only
barred, but even sealed up: ὅστις δὲ μοχλοῖς καὶ διὰ σφραγισμάτων
σώζει δάμαρτα, δρᾶν τι δὴ δοκῶν σοφόν, μάταιός ἐστι καὶ φρονῶν
οὐδὲν φρονεῖ. Cp. Aristoph. Thesmoph. 414-428· Store-cham
bers were osten settled, both in Greeee (Aristoph. Lys. 1199)

and at Rome, Plaut. Cas. ΙΙ. 1, 1 obsignate cellas, raserte anulum
ad me.

4. paucis: Sat. 1. 4, 73. ostendi gemis τ for the construc-
tion cp. Ep. 1. 15, 7. communis ‘what is open to all': com-
munis locus was a euphemism for a house os ill-same.

5. fuge, explained by schol. Cruq. ‘devita conspectum
hominum, ne redeas deterior’. Sehiitz defends this interpreta-
tion, denying that fugere can mean simply‘ to hurry off’, but
Senee. Epist. 108, 25 nunquam Vergilius dz'es dicit ire, sed
fizgere, quod currendi genus concz‘latissz'nmm est is surely a
sufficient desence (ep. Verg. Aen. v. 74o): and we may further
note that the book is represented as running away from its
master⁷s house. The asyndeton in non erit reditus is slightly
in favour of Schiitz's view: it is a little more natural to regan]
the appended clause as giving the reason for what has been said,
than as a cantion to be borne in mind, translating ‘for there
will be' rather than ‘but remember there will be '. But on
the other hand, as this is a valedictory addre<s‚ and as Horace
in vv. 19 ff. gives his book a commission to discharge, it seems
quite necessary that he should express somewhere his assent,
however reluctantly, to its departure.

descendere: Bentley arguing against the current reading
discedere (which has only the slightest MS. authority, if any)
shows by a large collection of passages that descendere was the
regular word for going down into the Forum.

6. emisso: Ep. 1. 18, 71.
