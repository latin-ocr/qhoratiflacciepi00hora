‘And are our tuneful poets less troubled by this madness?' Qui
minus is merely a rhetorical question, and does not at all mean
qno modo fit ut minus? Bentley⁷s conjecture versat for vexat is
needless; this absurd ‘mutual admiration' based upon vanity is
not really, as he thinks, a matter of pleasure in the long run,
rather than annoyance.

91. carmina compono ‘I am a writer of lyrics'3 though for
the time being Horace had abandoned this form of composition,
he speaks of it as his most distinctive style.

hic, probably Propertius, who delighted to be regarded as the
Roman Callimachus (v. 100: cf. Propert. V. 1, 63-64). It
chronology forbids us to regard him as the bore of Sat. 1. 9
(cf. Palmer's edition, p. 219), written about B.C. 35, he had pro-
bably published most of his elegies before the date of this epistle.
‘The charge of belonging to a clique of mutual admirers might
with a show of fairness be brought against one who, amongst
other instances of exaggeration‚ compared his friend Ponticus to
Homer (1. 7, 3-4). The expression caelatum novem Masis
opus is not more extravagant than many in Propertius. V. 96
is probably a hit at P.’s frequent use of the metaphor with re<
ference to himself. Again fastu and molimine just hit the irn-
pression which the style and perhaps the bearing of P. would
make upon an unfavourable observet. V. 94 is a clear allusion
to P.’s exultation at the reception of his poems into the Palatine
librar-y: see 1v. 1, 38 and note. Even Romanis has its sting:
1. 7, 22. Lastly, I trust that it is not fancisul to see in the two
words adposcere and oplivus, which are each only found in one
other passage in Latin, a travesty of P.’s love of archaisms.⁷

mirabile visu caelatumque novem Musis opus! an admiring
exclamation not, I think, used by the author of his own work,
as most editors take it, but of mutual compliment, as seems to
be required by the context. Bentley objected (1) that visu
could only be used of externa] appearance, which is out of the
question here: (2) that cadalum Musis could only mean ‘adorned
with figures of Muses' (as in OV. Met. XIII. 110 caelalus ima-
gine mundi, ib. 684 longo caclavcrat atgumento). Hence he
wished to govern these words by circum spectemus, taking them
in apposition to aedem. If they are interpreted of a book he
