248 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

5—17. T lte most illustrious heroes have not found recqgrnition,
while on earth, because of envy. You alone receive due lzonours
while still willa us.

5. uber pater here, as often, has the history of the Greek
Dionysus simply transferred to him. ‘The notion of his being
a protector of the vine was easily extended to that of his being
the protector of trees in general. This character is still further
developed in the notion of his being the promoter of civilization‚
a law-giver‚ and a lover of peace (Eurip. Bacch. 4²03 Strabo X.
p. 4683 Diod. 1V. 4) ³, Dict. Biog. Augustus is similarly com-
pared to the deified heroes in Carm. Ι. 12, 22, 25 ff., 33; ΙΙΙ. 3,
9; IV. 5, 35 f. There is a remarkable parallel (probably a
reminiscence) in Quint. Curt. V111. 5 Herculem et patrem Liberum
et cum Polluce Castorem novo numini (Alexandro) cessuros esse
iactabant: and further on ne Herculem quidem et patrem Liberum
prius dicat deos, quam vicissent secum viventium invidiam.

6. templa, apparently in its earlier wide sense ‘quarters':
cp. Ennius in Varro de Ling. Lat. V11. ἓ 6 (Muller) unns erit
quem tu tolles in caerula caeli templa ,· and again (ib.) 0 magna
templa caelitum commixta stellis splendide&

7. colunt, connected by a sort of zeugma with terras and
genus. With the former it would more naturally rnean ‘dwell
on '‚ but from its connexion with the latter, it acquires a kind of

reflected force of ‘caring sor’. Cp. Verg. Ecl. 111. 60 ab Iove
principium. . . ille colit terras.

8. agros adsignant, i.e. institute property in land. Sat. 1.
3, 105. The technical force of the word comes out in the official
designation of the lresviri agris dandis ‹zsszgazarzdz's. Cf. C. I. L.
1. 583 with Mommsen’s note, and the epitaph of M. Livius
Drusus, ib. p. 279 vii.

10. contudit, because according to the story the hydra’s
heads were bruised by the club of Hercules, Carm. 1v. 4, 61 f.

11. fatali ‘assigned by the sates⁷‚ Carm. 111. 3, 19 fatalis
incestusque iudex. The twelve labours enjoined upon Hercules
by Eurystheus were made obligatory by the cunning of Juno,

who had induced Juppiter to swear that the descendant of
Perseus born first on that day should rule the other.

d1³2. supremo, Ep. 1. 1, 1 (note), 11. 2, 173, ‘only by his last
en .
13. urit· ‘pains' here the eyes: used of thirst (Sat. Ι. 2,
114), gall (Sat. 1. 9, 66), of a shoe (Ep. 1. 10, 43), a burden
(Ep. 1. 13, 6), and ofblows (Ep. 1. 16, 47, Sat. 11. 7, 58).
αΓΜεΞέπιτηδεὺματα, ‘qualities’‚ almost identical with vir-

tutes: cp. Carm. 111. 3, 9 lzac arle Pollux et vagus Hercules
enisus arces attigit zgtzcas.
