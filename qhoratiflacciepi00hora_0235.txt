Bk. 1. Ep. XVL] NOTEs 199

56. non facinus: Horace is not, as Orelli supposes, speak-
ing as a Stoic, and adopting the paradox that all sins are equal,
which he ridicules in Sat. 1. 3, 96. Nor is he, as Ritter thinks,
making the master discourse like a Stoic to his slave; buthe
- simply asserts that is the 'extent of the pilfering is limited only
by the sear of detection, this does not affect the character of the
act, a view in which there is nothing paradoxical.

57—62. One wlco is vz'rltwus lo outwara’ appearance may
cherislz evil dosia-es in secret.

57. omne forum, not, as Macleane seems to suppose, all
the stra, but like omnis domus in v. 44, ‘the whole sorum'.
At the date of this Epistle the fimum Augusti was probably not
finished, for we know from the story in Macrob. Sat. 11. 4 that
Augustus was much dissatisfied‘ with its- slow progress. The
temple of Mars Ultor, which formed part of it, was not dedi-
cated until ΒΩ. 2, although part of the sorum was opened before
this date (Suet. Aug. XXIX). Hence only the sorum Romanum
and the small forum Julinm were in use at this time. There
were several tribunalia in the forum, but the ‘vir bonus’ would
only attract the eyes of those around the one, at which he hap-
pened to be acting at the time as iudex„

58. vel porco vel bove. According to the rules of the
pontiffs an ox was the proper animal to sacrifice to Juppiter‚
Neptune, Mars, or to Apollo: a pig to Juno Lucina, Ceres,
Bona Dea, and Silvanus. Cp. Marquardt Rom. Staatswrw. 111.
168. But doubtless the victims varied with the means of the
sacrificer.

59. clam: Martial (Ι. 39, 6) quotes among the signs of a
good man nihil arcano qui roget ore deam and the rule of
Pythagoras (quoted by Clem. Alex. Strom. 1v. 26, 173) was
μετὰ φωνῆς εὔχεσθαι. This passage of Horace is imitated by
Pers. 11. 3—163 and in Ovid Fast. V. 675-—690 a merchant is
represented as coming to the fountain of Mercury near the
Capene gatte, in order to get the god's pardon sor his deceit in
the past, and his aid for similar tricks in the future. Conington
(on Persius l. c.) says ‘Horace apparently merely means that
while the worshipper asks the gods for one thing his bent is set
on another': but this view is hardly reconcileable with the
language of the text.

60. Ιιεινθτῐια, the Roman equivalent to our Saint Nicholas ι
cp. Shakspere‚ Henry JV„ Part 1., Act 11.‚ Sc. 1: ⁴ If they meet
not with Saint Nicholas’ clerks, I'll give thee this neck ’. Schol.
Cruq. derives the name from latere, because thieves‚ he says,
were once called laterniones and lavernioncs (cp. Gadshill’s words
