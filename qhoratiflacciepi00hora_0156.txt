use in an inscrIption terlio or terlz'um ,· the opinions of his friends
being divided, on the advice of Cicero he wrote tert. as found in
Corp. Ι. L. Ι. 615. Tertium, etc. are always written by Livy.

diffusa. ‘ rael-:ed off ’ srom the dolium or cask into the amphora
or jar, which was then sealed up and labelled with the date of
the year. Some MSS. have deficsa, which means ‘ poured out’,
from the crater or mixing bowl into the cups. (Sat. 11. 2, 58.)
Cp. Cic. de Fin. 11. 8. ²3·

palustris: the ground round Minturnae on the Appian way,
near the mouth of the Liris in Latium was very marshy. It was

in thgege marshes that Marius attempted to conceal himself in
B-C. .

5. Minturnas. The Roman colonies at Minturnae and at
Sinuessa (more than nine miles to the south) were founded at the
same time in B. C. 296 (Liv. Χ. 21) and were ⁴ coloniae maritimae'‚
with the right of Roman citizens : the two are osten mentioned
together. The famous silens lllassicus overlooked Sinuessa, but
the wine grown in the plain was not of a first-rate quality:
cp. Mart. XIII. 1 1 1 de Sinuessanis venerunt Massica prelis:
condita qno quaeris consule .? mallus erat. The Comm. Cruq. says
‘ Petrinus mons est Sinuessanae civitati imminens, vel ager Sin-
uessae vicinus': if the former, the wine may have been, as Ritter
suggests, a superior kind of Sinuessan, a Beggwein, which view
however is hardly consistent with the inter. The Falernus ager
was close to Sinuessa, but rather to the east than to the north.

6. arcesse: cp. Roby 1. p. 240. Journal of Philology VI.
278 ff. The form accerse, whether of different origin or not, was
undoubtedly in frequent use, especially in later times: it is quite
absurd for Macleane to speak ofit as a ‘ corruption of the MSS.’
Here the word has its less common meaning ‘send ’‚ one as
legitimately derived srom the primary force ⁴ make to approach',
as the more usual ‘fetch’, which is here quite out of place.

imperium fer ‘ put up with my directions’. Horace repre-
sents himself as the dammas convivii (Gell. X111. 11), for whom,
according to Acron, the term rex was sometimes used. This is
a usage to be distinguished from that in Carm. 1. 4, 18 nec regna
vini sortiere talis.

and 50 we will be marry to-nzglzt.

’1. splendet‚ Roby§ 1460, S. G. ἓ 596: not ofthe brightness of
the fire, which would not be lit in summer, but of the cleansing
of the hearth or rather brazier, and the images of the Lares.

8. levis: if MS. authority is to weigh uith us at all, we must
adopt this sorm here, not leves.
