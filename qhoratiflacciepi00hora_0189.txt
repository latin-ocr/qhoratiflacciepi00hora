EPISTLE X.

Aristius Fuscus was an intimate friend of Horace, addressed
by him in Carni. 1. 22, and mentioned also in Sat. 1. 9, 613> 10,
83, in the former case as playing a mischievous joke upon him,
in the latter among other friends as optimus. Some MSS. here
have the heading' Ad Aristium Fuscum Grammaticum, and
Acron on Sat. 1. 9, 61 says hic fuit grammaticus illius temporis
doctissimus: here he says he was a writer of tragedieS, while
Porphyrion calls him a writer of comedies. There is mention
also of A rislii Fusci grammatici liber ad Asinium Pollionem (cp.
Orelli ad Sat. 1. 1.). It is clear that he was a literary man, and
from this epistle it appears that he did not share Horace's love
for the country and its pursuits. There is nothing to determine
the date of this epistle, but it may well come within the limits
assigned to the others in this book, i. e. between B.C. 22 and
B. C. 20.
