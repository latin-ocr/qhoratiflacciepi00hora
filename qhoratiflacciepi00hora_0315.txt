plebecula, used by Cic. only in ad Att. 1. 16, 11. Pers. Iv. 6
as usual imitates Horace. Suet. Vesp. XV111. puts the word
’ into the mouth of Vespasian: sines-ct se plebeculam pascere, with a
notion of contempt, and perhaps also as a specimen of the rough
language of the low-born emperor.

187. equitis: Bentley reads equili, which is perhaps a more
ζῗιὲαέ construction, but not to be thrust upon Horace against the

188. incertos ‘wande1·ing'‚ turning restlessly from one
object to another, and therefore not caring to‘give the fixed
attention needed for a drama, not accompanied by much spec-
tacular display. Bentley’s emendation ingratos has deservedly
found little approval.

189. aulaea, from αὐλαία, derived according to Servius on
Verg. Georg. 111. 25, ‘ab aula Attali in qua primum inventa
sunt vela ingentia'. It is more probable that the word meant
originally the portibre of a hall. In the theatre the curtain was
dropped at the beginning of the perforrnance below the level of
the stage, and raised at the conclusion. Cp. Verg. G. l.c.;
Ov. Met. 111. 111 sic uhi tolluntur fissis aulaea theatris: Cic. pro
Cael. 27, 65 deinde scabilla concrcpant: aalacmn tolll'lzm‘, i. e.
all is over. All MSS. here have aulea, which Keller is inclined
to think Horace may have written. But the confusion between
ae and e came in as early as the first century aster Christ, and
it is better to follow the true orthography.

premuntur ‘ are kept down ’.

190. fugiunt ‘are flying across the stage', with no notion of
ssight, as Orelli supposes. Cicero writing to Marius (1⁴ p. Fam.
V11. 1, 2) says quo qualem appamia non dubtlo quin animo

192. esseda‘ chariots', light open two- wheeled carriages,
said to have been used first by the Belgae( (Caes. Β. G. xv. 33,
v. 16) and employed by the Bryitons as war· chariots.

pilenta ‘carriages' ‚ covered tvo wheeled vchicles, easily
swinging (and thus connected with fillum the‘ su ung' or hurlcd
weapon,Vanicek‚D1ct.p,;1184) and used sor ladies (⁴ quibus
vehuntur reginae captivae' , Acron), and sor religious proces-
