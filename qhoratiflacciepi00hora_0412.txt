pressiori is a loose one sor ‘as cities grew’: strictly speaking the
circuit of the Roman wall was never altered between the tinie of
Servius Tullius, and that of Aurelian, a period of more than
800 years. It is not easy to recall any Greek town, of which
1110 expression is quite accurate, although Syracuse had new
quarters added to it by Gelo. The Long Walls of Athens were

not built to include a growing population, but sor military
reasons.

209. latior Bentley held could only mean ‘thicker’, and
hence he read laxior, quoting with his usual learning instances
in which the latter word is used in the sense here required.

But latus exactly equals our ¹ broad ⁷, which could be used here
without any danger of misleading the reader.

diurno: to drink wine by day was regarded as excessive sels-
indulgence in the earlier times. Cp. Palmer on Sat. ΙΙ. 8, 3 de
medio potare die. Vely little wine was drunk, as a rule‚ during
the meal : the comissatio was quite distinct, and often at another
place: cp. Liv. XL. 7, 5 quin comissalum ad fmtrem imus?

210. placari Genius, a Latin idiorn (cp. Ep. 11. 1, 143,
Carm.111. 17, 15 curabis Genium), but this does not show that
Horace is necessarily thinking only of Rome.

impune: ‘non contradicente aut lege aut moribus’ Acron,
‘with 110 sear of blame or punishment '.

211. numerisque modisque: Ep. 11. 2, 144-

212. laborum: Verg. Aen. x. 154 liberafali, Lucan VI. 301
libera legum Roma, a construction iinitating that of ἐλεύθερος.
Horace has (Carm. ΙΙΙ. 17, 16) cum fizmulz's opernm solutis, and
(Sat. ΙΙ. 2, 119)0pcrum vacuo.

213. turpis honesto: special seats in the theatre (the orchestra)
were not assigned even to senators before B.C. 194: cp. Liv.
XXXIV. 54: sor the lex Roscia cp. Ep. Ι. 1, 62. For the special
seats assigned to bankrupts (decoctores) cp. Cic. Phil. 11. 18, 44.

214. sic ‘quia indoctus erat populus’ Acron. motum
Orelli takes of the quickening of the time, and also of (lancing
adapted to this: the former has been already indicated in v. 211,
and the latter only seems to be here denoted.

( P· · ‚ 7 ·

216. voces ‘notes’. severis: the music os the harp {vas
always regarded as much graver and less passionate than that of

the flute‚ and therefore was the only music allowed by Plato in
his ideal State.
