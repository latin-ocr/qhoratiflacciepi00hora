Bk. ΙΙ. Ep. 1.] NOTES. 269

141. ferentem: the tense denotes what was usual, not the
state atv the particular time: ‘which was wont to bear toil in the
hope of respite·.

142. pueris et coniuge, in apposition to sociis operum; the
wife and children are the partners of his toils, slavery being
regarded as unknown in those good old days. Bentley rightly
rejected the et, which earlier editors had before pueris: cp. Sat.
Η. 2, 115, and 128.

143. Tellurem: Varro R. R. 1. 1, 4 invokes the gods who
are agricolarum duces: primum..Jove-nt ct Zellurem: secundo
Solem et Lunam-...tertio Cererem ct Liberam :..,quarto Robigum
ac Floram .·...item lllt'nervam et Venerem .·...71ec non etiam Lym-
pham et Bonum Eventum. Roughly carved altars to Silvanus
are not uncommon in museums : several such have been found in
England³ one of which records the slaying of a great wild boat·
which had defied earlier hunters.

porco: Cato R. R. ¹34 says priusquam messim finies, porcam
praecz'daneam hoc modo fieri oportet. Cereri [porca praecidanea]
por-cosentina, ἃς. (The repeated words are bracketed by Keil
after Pontedera.) It is clear therefore that porcus may be epicene,
and it should be taken so here, as Tellus was joined with Ceres
in the sacrifice: cp. Varro ap. Non. M. p. 16 3 lteredt'porca prae-
cidanea susczff'enda T ellari ct Cereri .· Serv. on Verg. G. 1. 21.
But there is no need with Lambinus, and L. Miiller to readporca.
Horace has the masculine sorni in Carm. 111. 17, 15; Sat. Π. 3,
1653 and Ep. 1. 16, 58; the feminine in Carm. 111. 23, 4.

lacte: milk is offered to Priapus in Verg. Ecl. VII. 33. pia-
bant :pie colebant, or more exactly pium (Le. propitium) fizcz‘ebant.

144. Genium: Ep. 1. 7, 94 (note): A. P. 209. memorem:
the genius, remembering how brief is the life of the man. with
whom his own is bound up, desires to be merry as long as he
can.

145. Fescennina licentia. Livy (vu. 2) in describing the
origin of dramatic representations at Rome says bea-nacula& artzfi-
filnes, quia ister Tusco verbo lndz'o vocabatur, nomen histrionibus
inditum .“ qui non, sicut ante, Fescennino versu similem z'ncongposi-
tum temere ac rudem alternis iaciebant, sed impletas modis saturas
descrtpto iam ad tibicinem cantu motuque congruenti peragebant.
v The original Fescennine verses therefore consisted osa rude and
extempore exchange of repartees. Paul. Diae. (p. 85 Miill.) says:
Fescennini versus, qui canebantur in nuptiis, ex urbe Fescennina
dicuntur allati, sive ideo dicti, qnia fascinum putabantur arcere.
There was an Etruscan town Fescennia or Fescennium on the
Tiber‚ near Falerii (Plin. 111. 5, 52, Verg. Aen. vu. 695), and
the unquestioned connexion of the Atellan plays with Atella in
