spatiis, Ep. 1. 7, 42. ‘claustra sunt carceres et est translatio ab
equis circensibus facta’: Porph. The bars in front of the carceres
or stans, in which the chariots and horses were posted, kept them
from the course, until the signal was given. The calx was not,
as Macleane says, the line from which they started, but that
which marked the goal, and hence it is often contrasted with
carceres, eg. Cic. de Sen. 23, 83 nec vero velim quasi decurso
spatio ad carceres a calce revocari.

10. rure. Ep. 1. 7, 1 (note): ‘you praise the townsman’s,
I the rustic's state’ Con. Ι (10 not see why we may not take it
thus: but Kriiger contends this would have required viventes,
as in Sat. 1. 1, 12, and with Ritter regards the phrase as a
brachylogy for ego te vive-niem¹ rure, tu me viventem z'n urbe
beatum dicis. Carm. 1V. , 45 non possidentem multa vocaveris
recte beatum supports the ἐπῄει· view.

11-17. T lze fault is not in tlte place. You are sickle, but I
am consistent.

11. nimirum ‘of course‘ carries with it no irony here3 cp.
Ep. 1. 9, 1 (note).

12. uterque. Although Horace passed in v. 11 from the
case of his bailiff and himself to a general reflexion, he still has
in his mind the position of two men wishing to exchange stations.
We may retain the indefiniteness of ‘either' in translation.
stultus ‘in his solly’. inmeritum ‘innocent’: Carm. 1. 17, 28
immeritam...vestem: Sat. 11. 3, 7 immeritus...paries.

13. Se effugit: Carm. ΙΙ. 16, 20 patriae quis exsul se quoque
fugit?

14. mediastinus ‘drudge’‚ one who was placed in medio, at
every one's beck and call. The Scholiasts (followed by Roby
ἓ 840) suppose some connexion with ἄστυ, and limit the use to
town—slaves; but the word may be used of any kind of drudge:
cp. Columella Ι. 9, 3 mediastinus qualiscunque status polest esse,
dummodo perpetiendo labori sit idoneus. Lucil. ap. Nonium,
p. 143 (Ι. 418 Lachm.) vilicum Arzktocratem, mediastinum alque
bubulcum. Astu was not indeed unknown to archaic Latin: but
it seems more probable that the word was formed aster the analogy
of clandestinus, where, if -des- was originally, as Corssen 12 462
thinks, the stem of dies, all consciousness of its origin had long
been lost. Orelli's derivation of ntesqmtz from this word is
erroneous: ep. Diez, Etym. Dict. Prof. Palmer suggests that
mediastinus=vicarius‚ a middle man, who stands between the
slave and his labour.

'tacita prece: cp. Ep. 1. 16, 60, Pers. v. 184 labra moves
tacztus.

186'. constare: his character was changed then since Sat. 11.
