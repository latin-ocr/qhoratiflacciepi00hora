196 ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE.

furem sc. me esse. pudicum, always in a sense more restricted
than our ‘chaste'‚ of freedom from the worst forms of vice.

37. laqueo collum pressisse paternum, used for the extreme
of villany in Carm. 11. 13, 5 illum et parentis crediderim sui
fivgz‘sse cervicem, Epod. 111. 1 parentis olim si quis impia manu
senile gutlurfregcrit.

38. colores„ much better supported than colorem. Bentley
admitted that the singular was much more common (cp. Carm-
1. 13, 53 lv. 13, 17), but held that the plural could be explained
of the colour coming and going, the man turning red, then pale,
then red again. And this is probably right. He quotes Prop.
1. 1 5, 39 quis te cogebat multos pallere colores ?—the soree of Which
Schiitz in vain endeavours to impair-—and Lucian Eun. 11
παντοῖος ἣν ἐς μυρία τραπόμενος χρώματα. So too Plato Lys. 222
Β παντοδαπά ἠφίει χρώματα. Browning's ‘cheek that changes
to all kinds of white' is a close parallel to the phrase in Pro-
pertlus.

40. medicandum is unquestionably the right reading, being
supported alike by the weight of> MS. authority, and by the
requirements of the sense. The old reading mendacem still
retained by Kriiger, involves a false antithesis: sor there is no
reason why mendax infirmia should terrisy mendaces especially.
The genesis of this blunder is made clear by the various readings
in the inferior MSS: a copyist’s slip must have giVen mendican-
dum by assimilation to mendax and mendosum, and srom this
came by conjectural correction mendacem and mendicum. A
mendosus requires caralim he is conscious of serious saults,
though not those which a mendax infamia ascribes to him.

41—45. T lle popular judgment of a man is (gflen erroneam,
bein g based on mere external correctness qf conduct.

41. qui servat. The definition of the ‘good man’ is that
which would be given by the popular judgment, one having in
view only external rectitude of conduct, and a good reputation.
But Horace shows that these may go along with grave moral
desects, known to all who are familiar with the man, as he really
is. Sehiitz well reminds us of the Pharisees of the Gospels.

consulta patrum: i.e. the man is a bonus in Cicero's sense os

thehword, a good Conservative, not inclined to make light of the
aut onnes.

leges iuraque: leges are the positive enactments or ‘statutes'
of the comitia centuriata, with which the plebiscita os the comitia
tributa came to be practically identieal: ius is ‘ law' in its
widest sense, iura being either the various component parts of
