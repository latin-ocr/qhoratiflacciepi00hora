any explanation such as Orelli's ‘non vocantis, sed declarantis
esse videtur’. Cases like v. 301 0 ego laevus, Sat. 11. π, ¹07 ο
magnus posthac inimicis risus, 11. 7, 69 o toties servus and the like
are entirely different. Persius simply copies Horace in 1. 61
vos o patricius sanguis. Cp. Kiihner Auff. Gramm. 1. p. 282.
According to Plutarch Num. XXI. Numa Pompilius had four
sons, Pompus, Pinus, Calpus, and Mamercus, srom whom the
Pomponii, Pinarii, Calpurnii, and Mamercii were respectively
descended. The real origin of the name Calpurnius is quite
unknown: Pompilius is formed srom a Sabellian pompe corre—
sponding to the Latin quinque: cp. Corssen Ι.2 116.

293. dies ‘time' and therefore feminine (Roby ἓ 337, S.⁶G.
§ 106), not singular for plural. coercuit ‘pruned.'

294. praesectum: this is a case in which the combined evi-
dence of the Blami. vet. and the oldest Berne MS. force us to
adopt a reading which at first sight is less attractive than the
vulgate perfidum. The latter would agree with quod and must
be taken as proleptie after castigavit ‘to perfection⁷. But if this
reading is genuine it is hard to see how the much rarer word
praesectum should have got into our oldest authorities. Besides
it is somewhat tautologous with ad unguem. XVorkers in wood
or stone were accustonied to test the finish of their work by
passing the nail over it: cp. Columell. XI. 2, 13 materies sz'
roborea est, ab uno fabro dolari ad unguem debet: Apul. de Deo
Socr. Prol. p. 106 Hild. non lapidem affi’ram—leviler ex omnibus
oris ad unguem 'coaequatunu [Similarly Verg. Georg. Π. 277
uses in unguem quadret for ‘exactly tally’.] Persius at once
imitates and explains in 1. 64 ut per leve severos tfftndatz’unctura
ungui& and Horace has Sat. 1. 5, 32 ad unguem factus homo.
Now it is a common experience that the nail is more sensitive to
irregularities‚ when it has just been pared; and this is the mean-
ing suggested by praesectum: it does not imply, as Keller,
Schiitz and others imagine, that the nails were cut away as
hindrances; this meaning would, it is true, be inconsistent with
the use of the idiom, but it is not required by the participle.
Hence praesectum is really better in itself‚ as well as better sup-
ported than pm‘fhctum. It is commonly said that this Latin
idiom is imitated from the Greek εἰς ὄνυχα, but it is doubtful
whether the Greek phrase has always reference to the same
usage: in the saying ascribed to Polycletus χαλεπώτατον εἶναι ,
τὸ ἔργον, ὅταν ἐν ὄνυχι ὁ πηλὸς ’γίγνηται the meaning seems to be
rather that the task is most dislicult when the minutest details
have to be reproduced in the clay model: ep. Overbeck Gesclz.
