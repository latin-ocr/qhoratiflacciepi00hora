Bk. ΙΙ. Ep. 1.] NOTES. 251

writes (Rome and tlte compagum p. 218) ‘The worship of
Egeria was probably indigenous to the grove of Diana at Aricia,
where we find that there was a shrine and sountain of Egeria;
whence it may have been transferred by Numa (?) to the valley
and sountain outside the Porta Capena.' Egeria was one of the
Camenae, and while we read of the Vallis Egeriae, the grove
with the temple in it is spoken of as the Lucus Camenarum
(Becker Rom. Alterth. Ι. 513—515). If therefore the Camenae
were worshipped at Aricia, it would be natural enough to speak
of them as uttering their primitive poetry on the mountain which
rose above their grove, especially for those who remembered the
muse-haunted Helicon and Parnassus. we may compare Quintil.
X. 1, 99 in comoedia maxime claudicamus, licet Varro Alusas,
Aeli Stilonis sententia, Plautino dicat sermone locmums juisse,

si Latine loqui vellent.

28—33. It is absurd to argue tlzat because tlte oldest Greek
writenw are the best, it is so also at Rome.

28. Graiorum: so Bentley with the vet. Bland. and some
few other MSS. Most MSS. have Graecorum.

antiquissima. quaeque points to the oldest writings as a class
as better than later works‚ whereas antiquissimum quodque
would have indicated that their merit was in each ease in
proportion to the antiquity. Madvig Gramm. ἓ 495 points out
that in the older and good writers the plural usage is confined
to the neuter. But Plaut. Men. 57¹ has uti quique sunt optumi:
Most. 155 optumi quique expetebant α me doctrinam sibi: Cic.
Lael. 10, 34 in optimis quibusque honoris calamam de Off.
11. 21, 75 leges et proximae quaeque duriores (where Reid corrects
proxima): Livy i. 9, 8 proximi quique. But it is only in Justin
and Florus that this usage becomes common.

29. pensantur} very rarely used in this primary sense of
‘weigh', and not in its derived meaning of ‘repay’ by any
writer earlier than Horace.

30. trutina. (Sat. 1. 3, 72);τρυτεἰνη (the first syllable of
which is long); so Πιεοὴὶηαεμηχανή, bueinazssuxa‘vn. Cf. Roby
ξ 2 39.

31. olea, Bentley’s correction for oleam of almost all MSS.
has met with very general acceptance. It seems impossible to
suppose that intra is a preposition‚ while extra is so evidently an
adverb. It is necessary then to supply in to govern olea from
the following in nuce, precisely as cum above in vel Gabiis
vel cum Sabinis: so in Carm. 111. 25, 2 quae nemora aut quos
agor in specus the in has to be anticipated: cp. Verg. Aen. vr.
692 quas ego te terras et quauta per aequora vectum accepto.
