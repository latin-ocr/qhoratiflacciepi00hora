418 ΑΚΒ POETJCA.

462. qui scis an: cpss v. 436. Plaut. Most. 58 qui scis an
tibi istuc prius eveniat quam milti? Roby ξ 1764. prudens
‘deliberately'.

proiecerit seems to have quite as much authority as deiecerit
which Keller and Schiitz prefer ε ‘ ideo hic praeferendum proiece-
rz‘t, quia proicere animam, proicere se, quae in bonis scriptoribus
saepe occurrunt, ubique habent significationem voluntarii discri-
minis deque eo dicuntur, qui servari aut nolit aut desperet’‚
Bentl. Keller's argument that deiecerit is better after decidit and
demittere seems to me to point the other way.

463. Siculique poetae. The accounts of the death of Empe-
docles varied : the best authenticated is that after an active poli-
tical life in Agrigentum he was compelled to leave it and retire to
the Peloponnesus, where he died (probably about B.C. 432) : his
followers seem afterwards to have invented in his honour a myth
that he had disappeared mysteriously at a sacrificial banquet3
while his enemies accounted sor his disappearance by saying that
he had thrown himself down the crater of Etna, in the hope that
he might be considered to have been carried to heaven, but that
the trick was discovered when one of his bronze sandals was cast
up by the volcano. Others said that he had been killed byafall
from a chariot, that he had hanged himself. or that he had been
drowned by accident: cp. Diog. Laert. VIII. 63ff. Zeller, Gr.
Plzil. Ι.2 500 (note). Mr Matthew Arnold in his splendid poem
‘Empedocles on Etna’ accounts for the suicide as that of one

who was ⁴ dead to life and joy' from brooding over the problems
of human life and destiny.

464. deus ε cp. Emped. frag. χαίρετ’, ἐγώ δ’ ὔμμιν θεὸς ἄμβρο-
τος, οὐκέτι θνητός. Empedocles was a strong believer in metem-
psyfizhosis, and this may have been distorted into the basis of such
a c arge.

465. frigidus, explained by Acron as riulfus: ‘ Empedocles
enim dicebat tarda ingenia frigido circa praecordia sanguine
impediri'. His own line is αἷμα ’γὰρ ἀνθρώποις περικάρδιόν ἐστι
νόημα, from which, as Conington remarks on Verg. Georg. 11. 484,
the statement of Acron is at any rate a natural inference. But
the reference is too obscure to have been intended by Horace
here. frigidus is rather ‘in cold blood ’: Schutz objects that it
ought rather to have the opposite meaning ‘ chilled with terror’,
and that a man cannot do such a deed in cold blood, a criticism
supported by Mr Arnold's ‘ Leap and νοαν, tlzou sea offire! My
soul glows to meet you Ι Ere z'tflag, ere tlte mists of despondency
and gloom Ruslz over z't again, Receive me! save me!⁷ Still,
helped out by the antithesis—itself very srigid, if it were not in
jest-with ardentem, it may bear this meaning. It is better at
any rate than Sch'utz’s, ‘ because he was cold'.
