for you to have a good audience'. The conjecture sal lepidus
has been made and even approved! Meineke assumed a loss of
some lines after v. 18 in which a link was supplied (ib. v. 71).
There seems to be a reference back to v. 4.

20. libertino patre: Sat. 1. 6, 45—6. in tenui re: his
father was macro pauper agello.

21. pinnas and pennas .· Lewis and Short well state the re-
lation of these two forms, on which others, e. g. White‚ are less

{atisfactorv Here the balance seems to turn in favour of the
onner.

nido with maiores ‘too great for my nest to hold’. Cp. Sat.

11. 3, 310 corpore maiorem: Carm. ΙΙ. 11, 11 aeternis minorem
consiliis.

23. belli...domique: the rhythm of the line is certainly in
favour of the interpretation, which connects these words with
placuisse rather than with primis. But is it possible to suppose
that Horace should have ventured to assert that his military
exploits won him favour with the primi urbis, even admitting
that he would have placed Brutus and Cassius in this position?
We need not take his hurnorous phrase in Carni. 11. 7, 10 relicta
non bene parmula as a seriously intended confession of cowardice;
but neither is there any reason to suppose that he particularly
distinguished himself. Besides Augustus, Pollio, Munatius
Plancus, Messala and others were distinguished in war as well as
in peace.

24. corporis exigui sc. esse: ‘short' not slight: cp. Suet.
Vit. Hor. lzabitu corporis fuit brevis atque obesus, qualis et a semet
ipso in satiris describitur et ab Augusto lzac epistula... Vereri au-
tem milzz' videris, ne maiores libelli luz' sint, quam ipse es. Sed si
tibi statura dest, corpusculum non dest, etc. If in satiris does
not refer by a slip of memory to this passage, Suetonius was
thinking of Sat. 11. 3, 309 aedficas, hoc est, longos imitaris,
ab imo ad summum tolus moduli bzpedalis, where the latter

clause is of course only a simile, though it gains in point from
Horace’s 'short stature.

praecanum ‘grey before my time ’- So the scholl. explain the
word. In almost every other instance in which prae is com—
pounded with an adjective, the force is simply intensive, e. g.
praealtus, praecalidns‚ praecelsus, praeceler, etc.; and it is as a
rule only when compounded with verbs that prae has the meaning
of ‘before-hand⁷; hence Schiitz (after Plewes) maintains that the
meaning must be ‘very grey '. But the formation of praematurus
differs in no way from that of praecautus, and that of praecox, prae-
sagus, praenuntius very slightly. So we may rest content with
