semper deest aliquid et quae nunquam expleatur, agitare de-
beat’. We arrive however at much the same meaning if we con-

sider that the direct question would have been agitatae me semper,
with the present used sor the future.

99. mediocriter utinum: ‘things indifferent' ‘quae Stoici
ἀδιάφορα vocabant' Or. Cp. Cic. de Fin. 111. 16, 53 quoniam
autem omne, quod est bonnm, primum locum tenere dicimus4
necesse cst, nec bonum esse nec malum lzoc, quod praepositum
(προηγμένον) vel praccz'pumn nominamus: idque ita definimus,
quod sil indifferens (ἀδιάφορον) cum aestimatione mediocri. These
ἀδιάφορα include in the Stoical theory all things generally con-

sidered good by men, with the exception of virtue, which is the
summum bonum.

100. doctrina: the familiar mquiry of the philosopl1ersch.
Plat. Meno ad mzsss ἔχεις μοι εἰπεῖν, ὦ Σώκρατες, ἆρα διδακτὸν
ἡ ἀρετή; ἢ ού διδακτὸν ἀλλ’ ἀσκητόνς ἢ οὔτε α’σκητὸν οὔτε
μαθητόν, ἀλλὰ φύσει παραγίγνεται τοι ς ἀνθρώποις ἦ ἄλλῳ τινὶ
τροπῷ. Similarly m the Protagoras, Socrates argues against the
view of Protagoras that virtue can be taught, though in the
course of the discussion he affirms that virtue is knowledge
‘which is the most teachable of all things'. Cic. Part. Or. 64
quonam pacto virlzls pariatur, naturane (ιιι ratione an usu.

101. quid te tibi reddat amicum, another reminiscence of
Plato: cp. de Rep. X. 621 c. δικαιοσύνην μετὰ φρπνήσεως παντὶ,
τρόπῳ ἐπιτηδεύσομεν, ἵνα καὶ η’μΐν αὐτοῖς φίλοι ὦμεν καὶ τοῖς
θεοῖς.

102. purezsz'ncere ‘what gives you untroubled calm’.

honos, public honours, especially office, which is often in-
consistent with money-making. Hence Schiitz’s proposal to read
ac sor an would really injure the sense. There are three alterna·
tives suggested ε but lzonos cannot be for honestas, as some have
taken it, for there is no contrast between virtue and a retired

life.

lucellum: a remembrance of this line, or of Sat. 11. 5, 82
tecum partita lucellum would have enlightened those persons who
were puzzled by Mr Lowe’s proposed motto sor the match-tax
stamp, ex luce lucellum. The word is used also by Cicero.

103. fallentis: Ep.1. 17, 10.
