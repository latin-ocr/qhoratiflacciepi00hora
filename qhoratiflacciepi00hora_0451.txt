NOTES. 415

Madvig ξ 359, Liv. 111. 36, 8 si quis collegam appelhzsset‚ ila dis-
cedebat, &c.). Sat. 1. 3, 4 is not parallel, because the verb 111 1110
apodosis is also in the subjunctive, which makes the sentence a
pure hypothesis.

439. negares: Roby ἓ 1552, S. G. ἓ 650.
440. bis terque: v. 358.

441. tornatos: Bentley argues at great length that though
the anvil and the lathe can each be metaph ›rically applied to
verses, they cannot be applied at the same time, and also that
tornatus like lzmatus could only be used of something properly
finished, so that it admits of no adv.e1b He sug< 0515 l? ν natos-(a
most unlucky conjectur‚e) ‘if they have thrice come 0111 bad v erses’
comparing Ep. 11. 1, 233. A thrice-repeated 1111111 is at least
as odd as the combined metaphors. T hat the toruus was used os
metal has been shown by several passages quoted by Fea. If the
finishing tool has been thrice applied without success, the 11115-
shapen thing must be placed upon the anvil and hammered up, so
that a new start may be made3 but not (as Orelli thinks) with a
new lump of metal, which is against reddere. Some editors have
adopted the conjecture firmatos, which is weak. Cp. Ovid
Trist. Ι. 7, 29 ablatum mediis opus cst incudibus illud (50. Meta-
morphoses), deficit et scriptis ultimalz‘ma meis: Propert. 111. 32,
43 incipe iam angusto versus includere torno. ἀποτορνεύειν 15
00111111011 111 1110 same sense.

442. vertere ‘to change’ (Ep. 1. 25, 39) with a slight zeugma.
delictum being the faulty line. This is better than to sayrwith
Orelli that there is a reference to the phrase stilum vertere, or
with Schissz, that it is for avertere ‘to remove it’.

444. quin=‘to hinder you srom’: Sat. ΙΙ. 3, 42 nil
zerbz' pereas quinfortiter adanm. Roby ἓ 16116, S G. §68:2. sine
rivali: cp. Cic. ad Quint. Fr. 111. 8, 40dz, quam zstezeptlcs qnam
se ipse amans sine rivali.

445. virbonus et prudens: Ep. 1. 7, 223 16, 3²- inertes
‘weak’, the virtute carentia of Ep. 11. 2, 12 3.

446. incomptis=incultzk of Ep. 11. 1, 233- atrum, both
‘black' in colour and also ‘gloomy’ as being a sign of condem-
nation; so Pers. IV. 13 nigrum vztwpmefigele thela‘ to obelize
wrong with a staring black mark' (Con.).

447. signum, the obelus — ‚ which was made with a cross
stroke of the pen, to signify condemnation: cp. Lucian XL. 24 ὸ
τα νόθα ἐπισημηνάμενος τῶν ἐπῶν ἐν τῇ παραγραφῇ τῶν ὀβελῶν.
Α χ was similarly used, and that may perhaps be rather intended
here3 but one MS. has obelum as a gloss.

transverso cannot be the same as verso, as some take it.
