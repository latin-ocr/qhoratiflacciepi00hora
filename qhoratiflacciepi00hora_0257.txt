68. de quoque, perhaps best taken with Bentley as=et de
quo: Porphyrio rightly says that there are three questions ‹Jm'd
dicas, de quo dicas, cui dicas. So Cic. in Pis. 31, 75 lu quid, tu
apud quos. lu de quo dicas, intellegis? It is however quite
legitimate to take quoque as the ablative os qm'sque, although the
expression is not to be explained with Orelli and others as for
quid de quocunque homine dicas: rather it implies that in each
individual case care is to be used. Cp. Madvig⁷s De Finibus,
Excursus Vl. p. 836 note.

⁵11. emissum ‘let slip’: A. P. 390 nescit vox missa reverti.
1 doubt whether the generally assumed reference to an arrow
allows sufficiently for the idea of carelessness here mv olv ed Cp.

. 72. non—ulla, to be taken closely together: nulla. For
the question of non with imperatives cp. J. E. Nixon in the
Journal of Plcz'lology VII. 54—59: Palmer on Sat. 11. 5, 91:

ieeur: frequently regarded as the seat of the emotions: cp.
Carm. 1. 13, 4 meum fervens dzfficili bile tumet iecur, ib. 2 5, 15
iecur ulcerosum, Sat. 1. 9, 66 meum iecur urere bilis.

melius poterit transcurrere quondam, Verg. Aen. ΙΙ. 367 qnondam
eliam victis redit 2¹72 praecordia virtus: cp. VI. 877. In Cic. ad
Fam. 11. 16, 2 quoted by L. and S. for this meaning of qnondam,
we must certainly render ‘of old’: in de Div. 1. 43, 98 quid ·
cum saepe lapidum, sanguinis uon nunquam, ἵει-ναι» interdum,
quondam etiam lactis imber dcfluxil the climax not less plainly
points to ‘once’ as the meaning. Hence it is doubtful whether
this usage is found in Cicero. Cp. the similar use of olim.
