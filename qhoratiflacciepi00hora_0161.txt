Bk. 1. Ep. Vr] NOTES. 125

umbris ‘guests whom you may bring': the umbrae were
guests not invited by the host, but brought by an invited guest,
as Maecenas brought Vibidius and Balatro to the dinner given
by Nasidienus (Sat. 11. 8, 22). Conington’s rendering ‘and
each might bring a friend or two as well' is inisleading: the
number of umbrae could not be more than four, if the party was
not to exceed the approved limit of nine, three on each couch ε be-
sides the remark was only addresscd to Torquatus, not to the
others.

29. premunt ‘annoy'. caprae=l22'rcns.· caper is similarly
used by Catull. Lxrx. 5, LXXI. 1, and by Ov. A. Α. 111. 193:
the feminine form only here, though certainly not, as Orelli sup-
poses from any feeling of delicacy, which however desirable ac-
cording to our notions‚ is not likely to have occurred to Horace.

30. quotus esse velis, ‘ how large you would like the party to
be': ‘name your number ’ (Con.): cp. Mart. XIV. 217 dic quotus
et quanti cupias cenare. Quotus asks a question, the answer to
which is to be given by an ordinal: hence we may compare the
Greek phrase ᾑρέθη πρεσβεύτης δέκατος αὐτόςε I have found no
exact parallel in Latin, but ‘ how many days ago ⁴? ’ (quotus iam
dies) answered by terlz'us iam dies est, is son‘iewhat analogous.

Cp. Ep. 11. 1, 35. Δ

31. postico ‘the back-door ⁷ such as has been found in many
Pompeian houses. Senec. de Brev. Vit. 14, 4 says quam multi
per refertum clientibus atrium prodire vitabunt el per obscuros
aedium aditus profitgz'ont.—fa11e ‘ give the slip to ².

EPISTLE VI.

Nothing is known of the Numicius, to whom this Epistle
is addressed, and his name is only introduced to keep up the
epistolary form, sor nothing turns upon it. Nor is there any hint
to assist us in determining the date : it may have been written at
any time within the limits between which Horace seems to have
practised this style of composition. The general purpose of the
Epistle is to recommend a philosophie calm as the true way of
regarding the various objects of human desire. But from v. 31
to the end Horace adopts a tone of strong irony, urging Nu-
micius‚ if he will not accept this theory of life, to pursue with
resolute energy whatever end he may choose to proposex to
himself.

Some can gaze unmovecl even on the grand phenomerza of the
heavens. How do you think tlzat we ought toscel wz'tlz regard to
wealtlz and honour ?
