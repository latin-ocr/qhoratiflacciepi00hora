NOTES. 351

79. Archilochum: Ep. 1. 19, 23—25 (notes). 1ambo: the
word ἴαμβος is undoubtedly derived from ἰάπτω ‘to fling' (Curt.
Etym.⁵ 537, E. T. 11. 154), and denotes originally a thnging, or
a verse flung at another, whence ἰαμβίζω ‘to lampoon'. When
Aristotle Poet. v. 6 says of Crates πρῶτος ἧρξεν ἀφέμενος τῆς
ἰαμβικῆς ἰδέας καθόλου ποιεῖν λόγους καὶ μύθους he refers to the
change from the mere abuse of the earliest stages to a regular
comedy.

80. socci, Ep. Π. 1, 174. Comedy is mentioned before
tragedy, though later in origin, or at any rate, later in reaching
literar-y development, perhaps as being more akin in subject to
the satire of Archilochus. Mr Mahat'fy thinks that we cannot
say what metre was used by Thespis, {or the recitations with
which he separated the choral parts of the earliest tragedies
(ι. 234): but as the next tragic poet Phrynichus used iambic
trimeters, while it is expressly said that he was the first to
introduce trochaic tetrameters in tragedy‚ although nothing of
the kind is said about his use of iambics, it is pretty clear that
the latter must have been used by Thespis. Yet Aristotle Poetics
lv. 18 says τό τε μέτρον ἐκ τετραμέτρου ἰαμβεῖον ἐγένετο, as
though the earliest tragedies had been in tetrameters: cp. Rhet.
111. 1. 9 (below). Four or five iambic lines, ascribed to Susarion‚
the reputed introducer of comedy into Athens from Megara, are
preserved, but they are not genuine. Comedy can hardly be
said to have taken literary form before the time of Cratinus,
and he used iambics largely, though not exclusively. Bergk
however (G. L. 111. 107) thinks that the use of iambics was
even earlier in comedy than in tragedy. Undoubtedly the
reason for the choice of this metre is that given by Horace,
that it comes nearest to the ordinary rhythm of prose. Cp.
Arist. Rhet. ΙΙΙ. 8, 4 ὁ δ’ ἴαμβος αὐτή ἐστιν ἡ λέξις ἡ τῶν πολλάν·
διὸ μάλιστα πάντων τῶν μέτρων ἰαμβεῖα φθέγγονται λένγοντες. So
in 111. 1, 9 he speaks of tragic poets who ἐκ τῶν τετραμέτρων
εἰς τὸ ἰαμβεῖον μετέβησαν διὰ τὸ τῷ λόγῳ τοῦτο τῶν μέτρων ὀμοιό·
τατον εἶναι uzu ἄλλων, and in the Poetics IV. 18 he says μάλιστα
’γὰρ λεκτικὸν τῶν μέτρων *ro* ἰαμβεῖόν ἐστι· σημεῖον δὲ τούτου·
πλεῖστα ’γὰρ ἰαμβεῖα λέγομεν ἐν τῇ διαλέκτῳ τῇ πρὸς ἀλλήλουςῑ

coturni. All MSS. have coturni here and everywhere in
Horace, and, as Keller says (Epil. on Carm. 11. 1, 12), in every
author who has been carefully collated. Cp. e-g. Riese praef.
Ovid. 1. p. xiii. Certainly all MSS. give it so in Quintil. x. 1,
68 and in Propert. 11. (111.) 34, 41, while Nettleship adopts it in
Vergil, e.g. Ecl. VIII. 104. There is therefore no reason to doubt
that this form sor κόθορνοι had established itself in popular
usage. But cp. Ribbeck Proll. in Verg. p. 424, where he shows
that the evidence is divided.
