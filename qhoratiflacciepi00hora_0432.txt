Phaedr. 276 A λόγον ζῶντα καὶ ἔμψυχον, οὗ ὁ γεγραμμένος εἴδωλον
ἄν τι λέγοιτο δικαίως. veras, preferred by Lambinus, has very
slight authority and is only a gloss.

319. speciosa loeis: loci has two chief meanings in rhetoric ι
(ῐ) ‘common-places¹‚ i.e. passages of abstract exposition or
discussion, which can be introduced in any place where they
may suit the context, but which are not limited to any particular
occasion: (2) ‘topics’ or ‘sources' from which arguments may
be derived, or ‘heads' under which they may be arranged. The
word is very common in Cicero⁷s rhetorical writings in both
senses: cp. note on Cic. de Orat. 1. 13, 56, where the laci deal
with such subjects as the gods, piety, friendship, justice, and the
like. In Quintilian's time the former meaning was the more
usual, and he sometimes follows it, eg. V11. 1, 41 plerique...
contenti sunl locis speciosis modo vel mlzl'l ad probationem con-
finalibus: but sometimes he returns to the other meaning, v.
10, ‘20 locos appello non ut vulgo nunc inlellegnnlztr, in luxuriam
ct adulterium ct similia, sed sedes algltmenlorztm in quibus latent,
cx quibus smzt pelenda. It is generally assumed that the first
meaning is that employed in this passage, ‘a play striking from
its brilliant passages'. Curiously enough Porph. gives exactly
the opposite interpretation ‘colligit saepe magis placuisse sabu-
lam, quae nudis narraretur verbis, qnoniam res spectatorem
delectarent, quam quae locis communibus explicaretur’. If he
had our text, he must have taken versus inopes rerum=l0ci
communes, the latter phrase having acquired by his time some-
thing of that notion of triteness and feebleness which attaches
to our own ‘common-place remark', but not to a ‘common-
place book'. But Schiitz argues strongly for the second meaning
oslacus here, in the sense of the psychological principles from
which the poet's sketches of character are to be drawn. Then
morataque recte does not add a quite distinct idea, but develops
the first. ‘Sometimes a play, isit is vivid in its way of dealing
with characters, and paints them might, even though it has no
grace (Ep. 1. 6, 38), froin its lack of weighty and artistic language,
gives more pleasure to the people, and keeps their attention
better than lines which bave no substance and melodious trifles'.
Schiitz takes as an example those characters in Shakspere which
are always life-like, even when there is something repugnant to
our taste in the language which they use. Certainly if a play
has at once brilliant passages and true pictures of character, it
is hard to see how it can be nullius veneris sine pondere et arte.
Ritter oddly interprets of the scenery of the poem. It would be
quite possible to understand merely ‘in places ’. Many inferior
MSS. have iocis.
