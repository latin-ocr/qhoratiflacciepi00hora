Bk. 1. Ep. xv111.] NOTES. 219

pression (especially in epistolary style), when Cumanis would
have suited the mette equally well.

4⁷. semum ‘gloom’ or ‘moroseness’: so Pers. Ι. '26 has
en pallor seniumque! of poets, and Sen. Hipp. 917 morum
senium triste. In Epod. 13, 5 obducta solvatur fron& senectus,
senectus is used in just the same way.

inhumanae ‘dis-courteous‘, not as a perpetual epithet, but
only under the circumstances.

48. pariter, i.e. like your patron. puMenta :pulmentaria
in Sat. 11. 2, 20, a passage like this in its general drist: the
word is contracted for pulpamentum (Cic. Tusc. V. 32, 90
pulpamentum Jizmes) and has nothing to do with puls, as some
have sancied. Puls ‘ porridge ’ is the simplest and most ordinary
fare of the labourer (plaut. Most. 815), pulmcnlum or pulpa-
mentum a tit-bit or savoury morsel, eaten with bread=6zpom

49. sollemne opus, in apposition to the preceding clause,
not an independent proposition. Hunting is called Romana mi-
litia in Sat. 11. 2, 10.

53. coronae ‘the ring' of spectators‚ as in A. P. 381.
Cp. Mart. VII. 72, 9 sic palmam tihi...unctae dcl fizvor arbiter
coronae.

54. proeua campestria. the feneing matches and similar
amusements of the' Campus Martius.

55. cantabrica bena, i.e. in B. c. 27—25 when Augustus
was himself in Spain. Dio L111. 25—293 Merivale, lv. ¹14
—119.

56. refigit ‘ is taking down’: Carm Ι. 28, 11 clz'peo—rafixo.
In B. C. 20 Phraates, king of the Parthians, made a treaty with
Augustus, promising among other things to restore the standards
taken from Crassus at the battle of Carrhae: cp. Ep. Ι. 12, 27
(note). The perfect rcfixit, which was found in most editions
before Bentley's, has very slight authority.

57. armis, Bentley suggested, but did not print, arvis,
arguing that there was no other nation besides the Parthians
from whom arms were or could be reclaimed‚ and showing that
adiudicare was the technieal term sor assigning disputed estates
to one of the claimants. But (Ι) armis is abl. not dat„ (ε)
arvis ‘arable land' cannot be used in the general sense of
finibus, except in a more poetical style than Horace is here
employing, e. g. in Ovid, where it is common.

58. ac—nugaris. The clause ree—absis is parenthetical‚
and suggests, not the purpose of the principa! action, but the
reason of mentioning it: Roby§ 1660, S. G. ἓ 690.
