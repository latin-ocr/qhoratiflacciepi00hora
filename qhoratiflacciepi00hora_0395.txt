by his conduct to his father-in—law Eioneus, to whom he had
promised many presents. &Vhen he came to claim them Ixion
prepared a trench sull of hot ashes, lightly covered over, into
which Eioneus fell and was destroyed. Ixion thus became
according to Aeschylus (Eum. 441) and Pindar (Pyth. 11. 21 ff.)
the first murderer of a kinsman, and was seized with a srenzy,
which ceased only when he was purified from his guilt by Zeus.
The treachery with which he repaid the god, and the punish-
ment infficted upon him, are known to all. Cp. Carm. 111. 11,

128. difficile est proprie communia dicere. Acron ex-
plains communia as ‘ intacta, non ante dicta', adding that when
a theme has been once treated by any one, it is proprium, no
longer open to all. In this view communia is identical with
inexpertum of -v. 125 and ignota indictaque of v. 130. Orelli,
with many recent editors, extends the meaning of communia, so
as to cover all general and abstract notions‚ such as anger, cru-
elty, cowardice and the like; and takes proprie dicere: ‘to give
a concrete character to⁷‚ i.e. to embody in consistent and vivid
pictures of individuals. This interpretation altogether ignores
the correspondence between communia and publica materies on
the one hand, and proprie and privati ium's on the other3 but
the parallelism is too close to be accidental. A meaning which
lies on the surface may aster all be the right one. Horace has
just been saying: ‘ If you choose a subject not previously treated
dramatically, you must take care to be consistent in the por-
traiture of your characters'. Now he seems to add: ‘ But this
is comparatively easy: the difficulty arises when you endeavour
to treat familiar themes in a distinctive and individual manner.
You are selecting a theme from the Iliad: then you are wise to
confine yourself to simply throwing Homer's poem into dramatic
shape, instead of attempting an originality of handling, which
would probably lead you into inconsistencies’. If this view οἱ
