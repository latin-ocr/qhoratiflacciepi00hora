NOTES. 341

me esse veum: cp. Cic. in Cat. 1. 4 cupio mc esse clementem,
with note.

36. pravo, cp. Ep. 11. 2, 44 (note).

37. Βρεοῦαῃᾱυωτ-ἅζφηηη qui specter: cp. Carm. 1. 32, 11
Lycum nigris oculis nigroque crine decorum.

38—41. T ke subject clzosen must be within the poet’s powers.
38. aequam=paretn‚ ‘not too much for'. Ι

39. versate ‘consider'. Or. thinks that the metaphor is
taken from porters, who ‘onera manibus versant, antequam in
humeros tollant', but it is too common to need such an explana-
tion : ep. Plaut. Trin. ἠ 3 multas res simitu in meo corde verso.
ferre recusent, Ep. 11. 1, 258.

40. potenter=1<aroi τὸ δυνατόν ‘in accordance with his
powers’. So Porph.‚ and this view has been generally adopted.
But the word occurs nowhere else in anything like this sense, any
more than δυνατῶς by which Ritter renders it: Schiitz quotes
(from F orcellini) Quint. XII. 10, 72 ut dicat utiliter, et ad efficien-
dum quod intendit potenter, which is clearly not parallel. May
not the meaning be rather ‘ with sels-restraint’, as opposed to the
common force of impotens and impotenter? So Cic. Tuse. Disp.
1. 3, 6 hominis est intemperanter abutentis et otio et litteris,
and Acad. Ι. 1, 2 'intemperantis enim esse arbitror scribere quod
occultari velit. [I think the sense is ‘he who spends all his powers
on the choice ’‚ i.e. ⁴ who uses every effort to ehoose aright '. J. S. R.]

41. facundia: cp. Cato's golden rule for an orator ‘rem ¹,
tene, verba scquentur’. ff

42—44. T lte virtue of arrangement lies z'n a choice qf what
has to be said at tlte time.

42. ordinis, repeated by anaphora, as the subject-matter of
this and the next two lines. The general rule περὶ τῆς εὐταξίας
(Porph.) is given in brief, for the detailed precepts depend
entirely on the nature of the matter dealt with.

venus ‘charm’, v. 320.

aut. ego fauor ‘ or else I arn quite mistaken'‚ i.q. nz‘ fallor.
Cp. Ov. Met. 1. 607 aut egosallm‘, αιιί ego laedor: Liv. praef. aut
me amor suscepti negotii fizllz't, ant, etc. The reading of many
inferior MSS. lmud or lzaut is not an indication of the original
identity of the two words, as some have thought (cp. Donaldson's
Latin Grammar, p. 194): the notion of a connexion between
the two words is now abandoned by all scholars (cp. Corssen
Ausspr. 11. p. 595): but is due simply to a misunderstanding of
the phrase.
