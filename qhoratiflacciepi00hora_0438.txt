explains why we are such severe critics of those arts which exist
only to give us pleasure, and which miss their end altogether if
they fail to do so.

370. mediocris, the only adjective with stem in -cri which
regularly retains —is in the nom. sing. masc. Neue Formenl. 11.
10. diserti, strictly speaking not so strong as ‘eloquent' (cp.
Cic. Brut. 5, 18 M. Antonius..‚disertos ait se vidisse multos,
eloquentem omnino neminem), but here practically equivalent
to 1t. ·

371. Messallae. M. Valerius Messalla Corvinus, the patron
of Tibullus (circ. B.C. 65—A.D. 2), and perhaps known to Horace
at Athens, won high distinction as lieutenant to Cassius at
Philippi. Afterwards he attached himself to Antonius, but in
B.c. 36 he joined Octavian, and in Β. C. 31 he was consul and
commanded the centre of the fleet at Actium. Of his eloquence
Tacitus Dial. 18 says Cicerone mitior Corvinus et dulcior et in
verbis magis elaboratus (cp. c. 21 ad fin.): Quintil. X. 1, 113
At Messalla nitidus et candidus et quodam modo praeferens in
diceudo nobflilalem suam, viribus minor [quam Asinius} He
and Asinius Pollio are commonly coupled as the last of the older
group of orators (Quint. Χ. ῐ, 23). There is a very good notice
of him in Smith's Dz'ct. Bz'og: no. 8. Cp. Carm. 111. 21, Sat.
1. 10, 29.

Cascellius, an eminent lawyer, distinguished however not
so much for his learning (Dig. 1. tit. ΙΙ. 2, 45 Trebatiusperz'lz'or
Cascellio, Cascellius Trebatio eloquentior fitzlrse dicitur, Ofilius
utroque doctior) as for his wit and boldness (Macrob. 11. 6, 1
iuris consztllus urbanitatis mirae libertatisque: cp. Val. Max.
VI. ¹2, 12 vir iuris civilis scz'enlz'a clarus, quam periculose con-
lumaxl). It was not this Cascellius to whom Scaevola the
augur used to reser clients who consulted him on praediatorian
law (Cic. p. Balb. 20, 45, Val. Max. VIII. 12, 1), sor Scaevola
died shortly after B.C. 88, by which time Cascellius cannot
have gained any reputation: besides Μι- Reid (on Cic. l. c.) has
shown that Valerius was mistaken in supposing that the Cas-
cellius of Cicero’s story was a lawyer at all. He may have
been the father os the lawyer. Cp. Introd. The evidence which
connects Cascellius with B.C. 56 is the story told by Macrobius
(l. c.), that he was consulted by a client at the time when
Vatinius was giving a gladiatorial show, probably in the year
when he was candidate for the praetorship.

372. in pretio est: ‘has his value.' [This is a regular
phrase of persons or things which not holding the highest place,
are yet of some value. Cf. Plaut. Asin. 1. 1, 46 lu primm
sentis: nos samm z'lz pretio sumus: Poen. Ι. 2, 1 17 primum prima
salva sis et secunda tu secundo salve in pretio: tertia salve extra
