less celebrated Olympic games in Greece. coronari Olympia.

(Hales), ‘the race, where that innnortal gailand is to be run
sor not without dust and heat’ .

52. Horace throws out somewhat abruptly a philosophie
common—place, and then goes on to point out how it is practi-
cally denied by the conduct of most men.

man z's measured by what lle llas, but even tlze boys know that

54. Ianus summus ab imo, a difficult phrase. Horace (Sat.
11. 3, 18) speaks of a medius lanus at which a man’s fortune
was wrecked: and' Cicero (de Off. 11. 24, 87) of those who sit
ad medium Ianum, plying their business as bankers διο, In
Phil. VI. 5, 15 he makes mention of a statue erected L. An-
tonio a medio lano patrono, and adds stane? Ianus medius in
L. A ntonlz' clientela est? Quis unquam in illo lano inventus
est, qui L. A ntonio mille nummum fi’rrct expensum ,9 It is clear
therefore that medius Ianus was equivalent to our 'Change; but
it is not certain what the precise meaning of Janus was. Becker
(Rom. Alt. Ι. p. 326), followed by ΜΓ Burn (Rome and the Cam-
pagna, p. 105) supposes that three or more lanz* stood at various
points along the north-east side of the Forum, similar to the
Ianus Quadrifrons which still stands in the Forum Boarium,
construeted of four archways‚ joined in a square, with an allz'ca
or a chamber above them. He thinks that the bankers spoken
of by Horace and Cicero transacted their business partly in
these chambers, and partly below under the archways. It has
even been suggested that the foundations of the rm’dius lanus
have been discovered. But the scholiast of Cruquius says ‘Ianus
autern hic platea dicitur, ubi mercatores et feneratores sortis
causa convenire solebant'3 and certainly lanus is often used
in the sense of an arcade or passage, rather than an arch.
Hence Dr Dyer in Dict. Geogr. 11. 774b conjectures that
Ianus was the name applied to the street at the north side of
the sorum, a view supported at some length by Mr Nicholls in
his ‘Roman Forum ', p. 240 ff. 1f this view be correct (and
it has the support of Bentley), we must translate ‘the whole
