famous athlete contemporary with the poet. This quite dis-
poses of the notiou that there may be a reference to the Farnese
Hercules, the work of the sculptor Glycon. The reading Mi-
lonis mentioned by Acron, is simply the substitution of a more
familiar name. Cp. Arrian Epict. Diss. 1. 2, 37 οὐδὲ ’γάρ Μίλων
ἔσομαι, καὶ ὅμως οὐκ ἀμελῶ τοῦ σώματος· οὐδὲ Κροῖσος, καὶ οἰκ
ἀμελῶ τῆς κτήσεως· οὐδ’ ἁπλῶς ἀλλον τινὸς τῆς ἐπιμελείας, διὰ,
τὴν ἀπόγνωσιν τῶν ἄκρων, αφιστάμεθα.

prohiberez‘guard’ cp. Cic. de Ofs. 11. 12, 41 cum prolzz'bmt
iniuria tenuiores (with Holden's note) z Carm. 1. 27, 4 Bacchum
prohibete rixis: similarly with arcere Ep. l. 8, 10. nodosa, gout

roduces chalk-stones in the fingers, as with Milton, who in his
fater years was ‘pale but not cadaverous, his hands and fingers
gouty and with chalk-stones’: cp. Sat. 11. 7, 15 postquam
illi iusta cheragra contudit articulos.

32. quadam...†2enus, formed like hactenus, ealcnus etc.,
introduced by Cruquius from the Bland. Vet. and defended by
Bentley against the earlier reading quodam which has equal
MS. authority, but is only a copyist’s correction. quadamtenus
is used repeatedly by Pliny the Elcler: the other form would
not be good Latin, tenus never being employed with an adverb
of direction‚ Ιίοῇγς δ 2164. Ι see no reason to suppose that
Horace' 1s speaking with any irony here.

33. fervet'‘is fevered'. For the mood cp. Roby ἓ 1553,
S. G. ἕ 651. Horace appears to have been especially struck by
the greed for money in his own time, and refers to this with
great frequency: Sat. 1. 4, 26, ΙΙ. 3. 82; Ep. ΙΙ. 1, 119, ΙΙ. 2,
148, &c. cupidine always masculine in Horace, never in Vergil:
Ovid‘s practice varies: cp. Neue Fomnenlelzre, 1. 65 5.

34. verba. et voces, ‘spells and strains'‚ the former ap-
parently magic formulae, (Verg. G. 11. 129 miscueruntque herbas
et non innoxia verba) the latter incantations, so that Horace
inverts the order of Euripides (Hipp. 478) εἰσὶν δ’ ἐπῳδαὶ καὶ
λόγοι θελκτήριοι· φανήσεταί τι τῆσδε φάρμακον νόσου. The term
voces however probably also includes instrumental as well as
vocal music (cp. Sat. Ι. 3, 8, Ep. 1. 2, 23, A. P. 216), to both
forms of which great efficacy was ascribed in allaying paim e. g.
