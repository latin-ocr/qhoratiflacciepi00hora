408 ARS POETJCA.

for the difference between the two cp. Lidd. and Sc. s. v.‚ Plut.
Solone. xxv. (Vol. 1. p. 193 Clough). Dionysius says th’at the
Twelve Tables were first engrav ed on bronze (στήλαις χαλκαῖςε
so Mommsen Ι. p. 290), but other authorities say ivory (Pom-
ponius in Dig. Ι. 2, 2, cp. Niebuhr Hist. 11. 316 note). and

Arnold (Hz'st. Ι. 256 note) thinks that Livy's simple tabulae (111.
34) points to wood.

400. sic: i.e. as civilization grew. vatibus: Horace is
thinking of mythical poets like Linus, Orpheus, Musaeus.

honor: in v. 69 Horace uses lwnffs: honos is far more com-
mon in Cicero and Livy than honor and is the only form used by
Vergil. Horace, Ovid, Tacitus and the later poets use the two
forms indiscriminately. Even Plautus varies, if we may trust
the MSS: cp. Trin. 663 and 697 with Ritschl's note. Note that
t'ne s is never retained, except in iambic words: arbos is on a

different footing. Cp. Neue Formenl. 1. 169, Lachmann on
Lucret. vi. 1260.

401. insignis, not an epithet of Homerus, but ‘gaining
same after these'.

402. TyrtanS‚ an Athenian sent to the aid of the Spartans,
when hard pressed by the war with the revolted Messenians.
The legends about him vary greatly: Bergk (Gr. Lit. 11. 247)
fixes his date at B.C. 640: others less correctly assign it to
B.C. 683. Cp. Grote Hz'st. Pt. ΙΙ. c. 7. We have about 120
lines of his elegiae poetry, containing exhortations to valour,
and snialler fragments of his ἐμβατήρια, anapaestic marching
songs. His poetiy was highly prized at Sparta, and sung in
time of war: on the strength of it Leonidas pronounced him
ἀγαθὸς νέων ψυχὰς αἰκάλλειν. Cp. Bergk Gr. Lz't. 11. 244— 258,
Poet. Lyr. Gr.3 393—405. Quintilian, Χ. 1, 56 says quid?
Horatius frustra 'lymaeum Homero subiungit? where Mayor
quotes passages from Dio Chrys. in which the two names are
coupled. But Crates the philosopher maintained that passages

like Hom. Il XV. 496 ff. were more rousing than anything' 1n
Tyrtaeus. mareS, Ep. 1. 1, 64.

403. exacuit: Bentley on Carm. 1. 24, 8 shows by many
instances how regularly Horace uses a singular verb with
several subjects if all, or at least the nearest one, are singular.
Cp. XVickham on Carm. 1. 3, 10; Bentley on Sat. 1. 6, 131.

sortes: v. 219 (note), Mommsen Hz'st. 1. 187 (note). The
oracles of Delphi, of Bakis and of the Sibyl are probably
especially intended. ‘A strange coincidence! that from that
Delphian valley whence, as the legend ian, had sounded the
first of all hexameters (ξυμφέρετε πτερά, τ’ οἰωνοὶ κηρόν τε μέ-
λισσαι).. ‚should issue in unknown fashion the last fragment of
