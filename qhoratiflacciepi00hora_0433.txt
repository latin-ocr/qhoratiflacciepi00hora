smooth, easy style of uttermce, so that Dionys. Hal. de vi
Demosth. 19 uses στρογγύλη λέξις as opposed to μακρά and
πλατεῖα of ‘well-rounded’ periods, and ascribes to Lysias (Jud.
Lys. 6) ἡ συστρέφουσα τὰ νοήματα καὶ στρογγύλως ἐκφέρουσα λέξις.
The style of Lysias is nearly the exact opposite of what some
people mean when they tall< of speaking ore rotundo. Co-
nington’s ‘ready wit and rounded phrase ' will do.

to be exact3 the duodecimal, not the decimal method os subdi-
vision was always used at Rome. The as was divided into 12
unciae, the uncia again into 4 sicilici, or 24 scriptula or scripula ;
sometimes even the scripulum was divided into 2 simplia, each
5-3-13 of an as. From scrupulus (a small scrupus) comes
scruple: the explanation of the bylorm scriptulum is not clear.
Probably it is a translation of γράμμα, which came to coalesce
with scrupulus. Cp. Roby L p. 447 f. S. G. ἓ 189, Hultsch

Carm. 1. 27, ιο dicat Opuntiae fraler slsqgrillae. Acron says
that Albinus was a usurer. This is probably only a guess.

328. superat: so rnost MSS: one or two have superest,
one superet which Bentley accepted: but the indicative lends
liveliness to the dialogue: R0by§ 1761, S. G. ἓ 751. Supero
not supersum seems to be the technical word in such a case.

poteras is the reading of most MSS.; a sew have palm-at.
Bentley adopts this, taking it as placed in the mouth, not of the
supposed teacher but of Horace himself, as a part of the nar-
rative: poterat dixisse, T rz'ens. This is fairly good, but a need-
less departure from the MSS. The past impf. is best explained
as an expression of some slight impatience: ‘you might have
told me by this time'; not as simply for the pres. (with Keller,
ἐξα), comparing Sat. 11. 1, 16, sor there too we have ‘an imper-
fect of neglected duty' as Prof. Palmer calls it. Nor is it ‘you
used to know’ (as Macleane says), which ignores the force of the
