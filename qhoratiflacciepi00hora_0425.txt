strengthen the sound of the voice, although it seems to have had
this effect. but neither was it invented by the Romans, so the
argument drawn from this falls to the grouy.nd It was undoubt-
edly introduced by Thespis to enable the recitet to assume
different parts. Horace here ascribes to Aeschylus inventions
which must have been made long before his time, probably in
consequence of his reputation as au improver os scenic properties
generally. Cp. Suidas: Αἰσχιλος εἶρε προσωπεῖα δεινὰ και χρωμασι
κεχρισμένα ἔχειν τοὺς τραγικούς, καὶ ταῖς ἀρβυλαις, ταῖς καλουμέ-
ναις ἐμβάταις, κεχρῆσθαι. On the Roman stage the mask was
first used (according to Donatus) by Minucius *Prothymus about
B.C. 120—100. Others say that Roscius first used it. Ribbeck
(Ram. Trag. p. 661) suggests that Minucius may have been the
director of the troupe in which Roscius acted. As the orchestra
was seated sor spectators at Rome, they were brought much
nearer to the actors than in Greecc, and the innovation was dis-
liked (Cic. de Orat. 111. 59, 221 senes..personatum ne Roscium
quidem magno opere laudabant), although the fire in the actor's
eyes was still visible (ib. 11. 46, 193). Aesopus seems to have
acted, at least sometimes, without a mask (Cic. de Div. 1. 37, 80
vidi...z'n Aesopo lantum ardorem vultuum afqzce motuum, etc.).

culate loudly’, on the ground that ‘there is nothing about style
here '. But in face of the frequent references in Aristophanes to
the losty elevated style of Aeschylus, it is hardly possible to
suppose that there is no allusion to it. There is of course a
natural connexion between a loud utterance and high· flown dic-

founder of the Attio copmedy‚ was at least as early as Thespis:
but ‘comedy did not attract attention at first because it was not
a serious pursuit. Thus the archon did not assign a chorus to
the comte poets till late.. .but it was not until it had attained to
some degree of form that its poets were recorded' (Arist. Poet-
c. V.>. Chionides is called the first writer of the old comedy
πρωταγωνιστης τῆς ἀρχαίας κωμῳδίας Suid. ): Magnes was nearly

contemporary3 next to whom came Cratinus (born Β. C. 159) the
real originator of political comedy (cp. Mahaffy Gr. Lit. 1. 4²4)-
We do not know of any victory that he gained earlier than
Β. C. 452, which was shortly after the death of Aeschylus.
