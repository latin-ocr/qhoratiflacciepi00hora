honestum officium, not, 1 think, as in Ep. 11. 17, 21, of the
attentions due to his patron, though some good editors take it
so, but more generally.

especially by the ἀνατοκισμός, by which the interest due was
added to the principal, as osten now by usurers renewing bills.

ad imum, ‘finally ², a rare use of the phrase, sor which ad
extremum and ad postremum are inore usual. In A. P. 126 ad
imum =‘to the last ”.

36. Thraex erit, i-e. he will turn gladiator, the last resource
of the fast young Roman nobleman: cp. Juv. XI. 1—-23. Thraex
seems the best form to adopt here, although found in only one
or two good MSS. But Orelli’s canon, that Thraex or Threx
is the form used in Latin to denote a kind of gladiator, lerax
for a Thracian, does not hold good always.

37. imus: the old reading was ullius, which Bentley first
rejected as out of place here3 it is evidently only due to a false
assimilation ῐὸ unquam. But the preponderance os MS. au·
thority sor ullius is so great that Keller thinks it must have been
an error in the archetype. Illius refers to the potens (v. 44) and
venerandus (v. 73) amicus, whoever he may have been, who
appears as ille in v. 40. The counscl here given is nearly iden-
tical with that of vv. 62—71; and it comes in with a certain
abruptness after what has been said of the extravagant and
self-indulgent dependent. Hence Lehrs places vv. 72—75 imme-
diately after v. 36, a course which makes the connexion more
natural, and supplies in dominus a natural reference for illius.
Schiitz‚ accepting this transposition, further places vv. 69—71
aster v. 38, and thereby brings v. 68 into very suitable juxta-
position with v. 76. There can be no doubt, I think, that this
greatly improves the sequence of the thought, and in a writer
