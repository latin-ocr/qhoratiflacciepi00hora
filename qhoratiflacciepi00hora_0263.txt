Bk. Ι. Ep. XIX.] NOTES. 227

1- 20. Cratinus of old, Maecenas, held that poems destined
to immortality were always inspired by wine ,· amt from tlte
earliest days poets leave been topers. J said tlzat tlce sober were
better fitted for business than poetry .· and since then my imitators
lzave been always drinking. But more is needed sor successful
rabah-y, than an apz'ng cffdrcss and looks.

1. docte : cp. Carin. 111. 8, 5 docte sermones utriusque linguae.

Cratino: the fondness of Cratinus sor wine was made the
subject of many jests among his contemporaries. Aristophanes
in the Peace (700—703) says that he died of grief at seeing a
jar full of wine smashed in an invasion of the Laeedaemonians,
a joke which gains instead of losing point, if we accept the
statement of the Schol. on Ar. Av. 521 that he was living at
the time. Cp. also Schol. on Eq. 400 ὡς...με’θυσον διαβάλλει
τὸν Κρατῖνον. He adds that in his play of the Πυτίνη Cratinus
represented himself as lawfully married to Κωμῳδιά, who wished
to leave him, and to bring an action against him for neglect,
because he had deserted her for Μέθη. Athenaeus (ΙΙ. 9 p. 149
Schweigh.) has preserved an epigmm on him by Nicaenetus‚
οἶνός τοι χαρίεντι πέλει ταχὺς ἵππος dorda· ὕδωρ δὲ πινων ὀὐδὲν
αν τέκοι σοφόν. ταῦτ’ ἔλεγεν, Διόνυσε, καὶ ἔπνεεν οὐχ ενὸς ἀσκοῦ
Κρατῖνος, ἀλλὰ παντὸς ὠδώδει πίθου.

puellae.

3. potoribus: Sch'utz takes this as an ablative, like textore
in 'v 13. I think it is unquestionably a dative (Roby ἓ 1146,
S. G. § 476); and cannot see why a construction 1011ῃά twice

Here direct agency is denoted. in ν, 13 textore indicates rather

cases differ ‘materia-Hy from those in which the ablative of the
substantive is accompanied by an adjective, for 11 luch cp. note
on Ep. Ι. 1, 94.
