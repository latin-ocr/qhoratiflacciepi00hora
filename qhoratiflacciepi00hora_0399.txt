NOTES. 363

liasts say that Antimachus, in relating the return of Diomede,
began with the history os Meleager, the brother os his father
Tydeus, and filled twenty-four books before he even got as sar
as the campaign of the Seven against Thebes, in which Tydeus
sell. But as the Thebais of Antimachus—a poern, which though
not generally popular, won sor its writer in the judgment of
some crities a place next to Homer (ep. Quintil. Χ. I, 53 with
Mayor's noteJ—-can barely have touched upon the return of
Diomede from the Trojan XVar, there is probably some error in
the tradition. &Velcker Ep. Cyclas p. 103 supposes the refer-
ence here to be to the return of Diomede to Aetolia after the
campaign of the Epigoni against Thebes. But it is hardly pos-
sible to understand the ‘reditus D? of anything but his more
famous return from Troy (cp. Verg. Aen. VIII. 9, XI. 226 etc.).
Hence it is better to suppose that there is no reference to Anti-
machus or his Thebais at all, but to some Cyclie poem, now
unknown, belonging to the legendary cycle os the Νοστοί.

14⁷. gemino—ab ovo, i.e. from the birth of Helen. Servius
on Verg. 111. 338 says Ledam luppiter in cygnum mulalus gravi-
dam fecit, quae ovum peperisse dicitur, unde uati sunt Helena,
Castor et Pollux. Horace here follows another form of the story,
according to which Castor ancl Pollux were born from one egg
(cp. Sat. ΙΙ. I, 26 ovo prqgrnalus eodem), Helen from another. lt
is possible that gemino ovo means ‘the two eggs': cp. Cic. p. Sest.
33, 82 gemini nominis errore ‘from a mistake caused by his having
two names ', Verg. Aen. I. ²74 geminam prolem, 111. 5 3 5 gemino
muro, IV. 470 geminum solem.

148. ad. eventum resanat ‘goes straight on to the crisis'
without undue digressions, or losi'ng the thread of his narrative.

in medias res: as in Odyss. 1. tr ἕνθ’ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες, ὅσοι
φύγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον οἴκοι ἕσαν etc. So the Iliad begins with a
scene in the tenth year of the siege; and Vergil plunges into
the midst of his narrative (Aen. 1. 34) with the words: vix e
conspectu Siculae telluris in allum vela dabant laeli etc. Prof.
Nettleship (Vergil and lais Ancieut Crz'lz'cs in Conington's
Vergil 15³ p. xxxvi.) happily suggests that this passage in Horace
is intended as a ‹lesence of Vergil against contemporary obtrec-
tatores ‘nescientes hane esse artem poeticam, ut a mediis inci-
pientes per narrationem prima reddamus' (Servius on Aen. p. 4
Thilo). Cp. Cic. ad Att. Ι. 16, 1 respondebo tibi ὕστερον
πρότερον, Ὁμηρικῶς, Quint. VII. 10, I I ubi ab initiis z'nclpiendmu,
ubi more Homerico e mediis vel ultimis ,Ρ ·
