NOTES. 357

dicor ab indoctis [meula grammatea& But here the expression is
more sorcible, if all the audience is supposed to law h at the
incongruity o⁷f lmguage, and there is nothing unnatural in the
phrase, used with a certain tone of sportiveness.

cachinnum ‘est verbum secundum ὀνοματοποιΐαν fictum a
sono risus’. Acron.

114. divusne an heros: this reading (or, what is perhaps
to be preferred, divesne) has the support of by sar the most and
the best MSS. But the contrast between a god and a hero is
not as great as we might think that the context requires: hence
many emendations have been proposed. Erasmus cleverly
suggested divesne—an lrus (the beggar of the Odyssey)‚ Landinus
Davusne—hennuc, approved by Peerlkamp, Lambinus Davusne
-Erosne.· but the Davus of a few inferior MSS. is doubtless (lue.
only to an untimely remembrance of v. 237 ε and there is a very
strong objection to it in the fact that, as Orelli points out,
Horace is nere dealing solely with tragedy‚ where a comic slave
is quite out os place. And unquestionably where the gods appear
in tragedy (as in the Eumenides, the Ajax, the Hippolytus and
elsewhere) their tone is calmet and more dignified than that of
human characterS, however heroic.

115. maturusne senex: cp. maturosque patres Carm. IV.
4³ 55·

116. matrona potens, reproduced in Juv. Ι. 69 of a woman
of high rank, like Clodia.

sedula. nutrix, such as the garrulous gossip of the Choe-
phorae, whose language (v.v 734—765) would ill suit a lady of
high degree. The nurse who narrates the fate os Deianeira' in
the Trachiniae is not garrulous.

117. mercator vagUS‚ a part assumed as a disguise by the
attendant of Odysseus in the Philoctetes 542 ff.

’deulton like the αὐτουργὸς Μυκηναῖος in the Electra of Euri-
pl es.

virentis: there is almost equal authority sor rigentis, but the
giZmOfl tdhis word as an epithet of agelli would be quite un-
p e .

118. Colchus, a fierce barbarian, like Aeetes: Assyrius,
sost and effeminate, like Xerxes in the Persae. The word
‘Assyrian' was used with great latitude by the Latin poets, sor
any Oriental:cp.Carm.11.11‚16;III.4‚32 lzlotz's Assyrii
mator: Verg. Ecl. IV. 25, Geofg. 11. 465: Lucan VIII. 292 et
polus Assyrias alter noctesque dt esque ve) ίιᾉί

Thebis : the Thebans were often represented as rude, lawless
and overbearing‚ e. g. Creon in the Antigone and Oed. Colon.,
