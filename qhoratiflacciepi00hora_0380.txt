streams from a Greek source? Is Greek alone the lawsul foun-
tain-head of a new vocabulary? Lehrs supposed a line to be
lost, closing with aut si, so as to supply the missing alternative.
But Schiitz appears to interpret more correetly by pointing out
that two ways of supplying what is lacking are touched upon in
vv. 45—53 ε (1) by a skilful connexion which adds new force to
current words: (2) by new words coined to express new ideas.
The second cannot be supplied from the stores of the Latin lan-
guage‚ or this method comes to coincide with the first (as e.g.
when ‘booking' is used to describe the purchase of railway
ticketslt hence it must be met from the Greek. It is hardly
possible, with Orelli, to suppose that Graeco fonte cadere means
simply to be construeted on a Greek model, and refers to com-
pounds such as centimanus (ἑκατόγχειρος), or phrases like aurum
vestibus illitum (χρυσόπαστος), or Cicero's indolentia for ἀπάθεια.
Madvig’s et si (Adv. Crz't. 11. 62) is attractive, but not necessary.

parce detorta ‘ deducta cnm parsimonia’, Or. ‘ a little altered
in form’, i.e. rnodified so as to have the form of genuine Latin
words, like amphora from οἰμφορεύς, placenta from πλακοῦς, etc.
But this is not consistent with his interpretation of Graeco fonte.

53. quid autem is used iu introducing a statement which
removes an objection which might have been made to a previous
statement z ‘ why indeed ?’

54. dabit...ademptum: ‘grant to...and refuse to V.’: the
thought might have been more exactly expressed by datum—
adimet. Some copyists‚ not understanding that the reference is
to the critics of Horace's own time, changed dabit into dedit,
quite needlessly. These critics allowed a free use of words
borrowed from Greek to the old dramatist53 why refuse it to
contemporary poets? Vergil was attacked for his use of Greek
words : cp. the quotations from Macrobius in Conington's Vergil,
Vol. 1.⁴² p. xxxiii. Among the words censured are dius, daedala,
trz'aelerz‘ca, choreas, lzyczlus. Cp. Cic. de Fin. ΙΙΙ. 4, 15 si Zenoni
licuit cum rem aliquam invenisset inusitatam, inauditmn quoque
ei rei nomen imponere, cur non liceat Catoni? where Cato Minor
is meant, not as Schiitz says, by an oversight, Cato Censorius.

55. varioque: Varius is connected with Vergil also in Ep.
11. 1, 247. Some MSS. have Varoque, as in Verg. Ecl. lx. 35.
For the freedom with which Plautus adopts Greek words in a
Latinized form cp. Sessar, Roman Pocts of tlze Republz'c, p. 165,
or Encycl. Brit. XIV. 331 ὀ.
