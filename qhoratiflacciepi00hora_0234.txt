198 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

whether negz’lat, which is found not only in Plautus, Lucretius
and Sallust, but also in Cicero, is intended here to have any
archaistic tinge, as some have supposed.

Sabellus τ Porphyrion says this means Horace himself, add-
ing ‘sed in hoc nomine est quaedam facies integritatis. Ver-
gilius [Aen. VIII. 638] Curibusque severis’. Horace is then
speaking in his character as a Sabine land-owner ‘a plain Sabine
like myself’. Lachmann however says (on Lucret. ΙΙΙ. 1034)
‘Apuli sunt huic (Lucilio) pro importunis ac petulantibus, ut
Horatio pro simplice Sabellus‘. The meaning is then ‘a man
who speaks his mind'. The term is a little out of place here:
one does not see why great srankness was needed to dispose os
a slave’s assumptions.

50. foveam ‘the pitfau': A. P. 459. Cicero Phil. lv. 5,

oveam mcz z .

mum.

miluus, a dactyl, as in Epod. XVI. 32, and always in Plautus
and Phaedrus. Cp. Wagner on Plaut. Aul. 314, Lachmann on
Lucret. VI. 552, Bentley on Phaedr. 1. 31, 1. The trochaic
scansion appears first in Pers. 1V. 26. The form 77tz'lvizts is very
late. The ‘kite-fish' is mentioned by Pliny Nat. Hist. IX. 20,
82 along with the hirundo as a flying fish. (In Ov. Hal. 95
the best editors now read iuli.) Orelli calls it ‘piscis rapax ex
‹lm-adum genere’, but what these dorades are, 1 cannot discover.
The flying gurnard is now called by zoologists dactylespterus,
the tmgrlo hirundo being the sapphirine gurnard: the milvus
may perhaps be the coryphaena, a tish which changes its colours
very beautifully in dying; this is not the case with the true
dolphin, which is really a mammal, like the porpoise.

53. tu is anybody, not Quinctius in particular nor the slave
addressed.—in te added because of the indefiniteness of nihil:
with a more definite object like scelus, dedecus, facinus and the
like, it would not have been used.

54. sit, jussive: cp. Mart. VIII. 56, 5 sint Maecenates,
non deerunt, Flacce, Marones. miscebis, ‘you will make no
difference between’: cp. A. P. 397.

55. unum, sc. modium: the suggested reading unam
would involve a ridiculous exaggeration. The reading of the
text was that familiar to Augustine (quoted by Keller) who has

si de innumeris milibus fimmvzlorzmz nminat mmm modium
(de Mendac. XII).
