36. decidit ‘has dropped off' like falling lem-:es cp Plaut.
Trin. 544 solstitzali motha d cz'dunt.

38. fims ‘limit', not, as Acron says, definition.

42. respuat, the reading of the best MSS„ is at the same
time, as Bentley showed, the only tense which will suit both
praesens and postc771.Ea1·lier editions had either re pull or
respuet. In the preceding line Bentley proposed to replace
poetas by ρνοόωῳιιε, a suggestion which certainly lmproves the

‘concinnity' of the passage, but 15 not needsul. Ι or the rhyming
os the two lines poetas. ,α las, which was one of his objections to
the reading of the MSS„ cp. A. P. 99- 100, 176- 73 Verg.

Virgilii) quotes eleven nime instances from the Aeneid. Most
of these seem to be purely accidental‚ like those in Horace: but

in the more archaic poets there are traces osan intentional use of ·

rhyme (cp. Ennius in Cic. Tusc. 1. 35, 85) and inalater age
Eustathius expresses his admiration of Hom. Il. XXII. 383- -.4

43. honeste ‘with honour’, i e. he will not disgrace those
among whom he is ranked.

45. caudae pilos: it is possible that there is a reference here
(as the editors generally suppose) to the story told by Plutarch
of Sertorius, how “when he had called all his army together, he
caused two horses to be brought into the field, one an old feeble
lean animal, the other a lusty‚ strong horse, with a remarkably
thick and long tail. Near the lean one he placed a tall strong
man, and near the strong young horse a weak despicable looking
fellow: and ata sign given, the strong man took hold of the
weak horse's tail with both his hands, and drew it to him with
his whole force, as if he would pull it off; the other, the weak
man, in the mean time set to work to pluck off hair by hair from
the great horse s tail: the former of course effected nothing, while
the latter had soon removed the whole tail: w hereupon Sertorius
said: ‘You see, fellow- soldiers, that perseverance is more prevail—
ing than violence, and that many things, 11111011 cannot be
overcome when they are together, yield themselves up when
taken little by little” ’(Clough' 5 Plutarch, 111. 400). But as
Horace 15 not teaching a moral lesson here, but simply illustra-
ting a logical process, 1 see very little reason to suppose that this
story was in his mind at all. The hairs 111 a tail may very well
have been a current example m the schools, like the grains 111 a
heap. The fallacy of the φάλακρος invented by Eubulides is a
somewhat similar instance.

46. etiam seems to be supported by the majority of good
MSS„ and 15 strongly comfirmed by the imitation' in Pers. VI. 58
