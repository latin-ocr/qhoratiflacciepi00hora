232 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

26). The word is not, as L. and S. say, akin to Germ. schwer
‘heavy’, but from root §ER ‘bind' Curt. Et. 355, or possibly
from root SAR ‘protect'‚ a derivation which has the advantage of
connecting it with servare.

20. bilem iewrath, Sat. 1. 9, 66, 11. 3, 141. tumuItus
‘the coil you ruake’, Con.

21—34. I am no slavislz imitator myself. Like my Greek
predam-vers, I lzave mainlained my own orzginality, in spite of
my deht to tlcem.

21. per vacuum ‘ on ground unelaimed by others '‚ a legal
term. Gaius 11. 51.

22. pressi: Lucr. III. 3 inque tuis nunc ficla [i.q. fixa]
pedum pono pressis vestzgia signis.

23. reget examen: ‘imitatus regem apium se sequentium
ducem' Porph. Keller says that fidel and reget have much
more authority thanfidz‘t and regit. As the vet. mand. here sup-
ports the bulk of his MSS. I have followed him with little hesi-
tation. The corruption appears to have begun with reget, to
which fidet was afterwards assimilated. Ritter reads fidit—-
reget.

Parios: Archilochus was born at Paros, though he lived a
roving life. Though not strictly speaking the inventor of the
iambic metre (Mahaffy Greek Lz'ccratme 1. 157) he was the first
to use it largely in literature. But he also employed the elegiae
verse, introduced shortly before his time by Callinus.

primus: Catullus had previously employed ianibic trimeter-s
(to say nothing of the dramatic poets); but Horace in his Epodes
had been the first to imitate the more complex Ἐπῳδοί. For
Epodes 1.—X. he used the mette in which most of the extant
fragments of the Epodes of Archilochus are written ‘ metrum Iam-
bicurn Senarium Quaternariuni 'z of the Archilochium IIm
(Epod. XIII.) and IIIm (Epod. XL), the Pythiambicum Ιω (Epod.
XIV.) and IIm (Epod. XV. and XVI.)‚ and the Alcmanium (Epod.
XII.) we seem to have no specimen preserved from Archilochus.
The Archilochium IVm (cp. Archil. fr. 103) is used in Carm. 1.
4: the Archilochium 1¹²¹ (cp. Archil. fr. 85) in Od. IV. 7, which
in spite of its position is probably an early production- It is
probable however that Horace in every case had a Greek example
before him : cp. Bentley⁷s note on Epode XI.

24. animos ‘ spirit ’-

25. agentia ‘which pursued’: when Lycambes of Paros
refused to give his youngest daughter Neobule to Archilochus,
as he had promised to do, the latter assailed him with such
