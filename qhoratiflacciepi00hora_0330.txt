294 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

at habenae: in the last, it goes on the end osv. 16. The decision
between these interpretations depends mainly on the reading
adopted as the last word in the line. The great majority of MSS.
have laedat, but the vet. Bland. has laedit. 1f we adopt the
latter, with Bentley, Meineke, Munr0‚ Ritter, Haupt, and
L. Miiller, it seems best to take des as jussive, and as said by
the vendor: ‘let me have the money, if the fact which 1 have
mentioned, that he once ran away, does not trouble you ⁷. (Cp.
Roby ξ 1575, S. G. ἓ 657 (b).) It is however quite possible, with
86111112, 10 render ‘should you give him the money, assuming that
you are not troubled '‚ &c. (Roby ξ 1569, S. G. ξ 653), ‘then he
would carry off his prize’. He argues that this is made necessary
by the fact that the vendor who is desiring to minimize the slave’s
offence, would not return to it again, and use such a hard word
about it as fuga, when he had already said enough about it to
satisfy the requirements of the law. There is something in this
argument, but it is hardly strong enough to make us force upon
Horace so awkward a construction, as that which is involved in
supposing three conditional clauses, in successive subordination
(si quis velit—(si) des—si laedit), to precede our apodosis. If we
read laedat, it is then almost necessary to accept the first view,
and to put the line into the mouth of Horace ‘you would give
him the money, supposing you were not to be troubled’, &c.
ferat is then added by asyndeton, as a second apodosis. The
great probability that laedit, if the original reading, would have
been assimilated by copyists to the neighbouring subjunctives is
enough to make us decide in its favour.

excepta: cp. Sat. ΙΙ. 3, ’185 mentem, nisi litigiosus, exasperet
dominus, cum venderet: Gell. IV. 2, 1 in edicto aedilium curulium,
qua parte de mancipiis vendundo cantum est, scriptum sic fuit:
titulus servorum singulorum ulei scriptus sil, coemto, ila ulei in-
tellegi recle possit. quid morbi vitiive quoique sit, quis flcgilz'vus
errove noxave solutus mm sit.

17. poenae securus: ‘without any fear of a penalty’ for

selling a slave without giving due notice of his defects. Roby
§13203 S. G. ξ 526.

18. prudens ‘with your eyes open’, deliberately. A. P.
462. Sat. 1. 10, 88, 11. 5, 58.

lex, the conditions of sale, not (as Schiitz) the state of the law.
est in some MSS. is placed before tibi, in others after tibi, in
others at the end of the line, in others it is omitted altogether.
Probably the original reading was tibz'st; and the est was written
over it, and afterwards introduced in various places (Keller).
Schiitz has shown that it could not well be omitted here, between
two verbs each in the second person.
