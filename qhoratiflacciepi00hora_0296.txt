’ 260 JJORA Τ] EPISTULAE.

who, aster serving sor a time in the army. taught sor several years
in his native town, and came to Rome when fifty years of age in
the consulship of Cicero (ne. 63), where he taught maiore sama
quam emolumento. He died in poverty when nearly a hundred
years of age. Suet. quotes for his severity towards his pupils
this passage, and a line written by Domitius Marsus (a younger
contemporary of Horace, who wrote epigrams), si quos Orbilius
ftrula scuticaque cecidit. If Suetonius's dates are to be trusted,
he had only very recently died, when this epistle was written.
dictare, Roby§ 1372, S. G. ἓ 543 (4). It is hardly a legitimate
inference from this phrase that ‘boys wrote, in part at least, their
own schoolbooks, as books were rare and costly’ (see Church’s
Roman Life, p. 7), and that Orbilius ⁶ was accustomed to enforce
good writing and spelling with many blows’. Ep. 1. 18, ¹3 and
1, 55 show that the purpose of the dictation was that pupils
might learn by heart. Cf. Cic. Nat. D. 1. 26. 72, de Fin. 1v. 4,
10, Mayor on Juv. V. 122. Nor were books very costly at
Rome: at least in Martial's time the eost of MS. books was ¹
even less than that of well-printed books now. Cp. Ep. XIII. 3
where he says that his whole book of Xenia will leave a profit
to the publishers if sold for two sesterces. Doubtless copies οἱ
Livius were somewhat scarce.

⁷2. exactis ‘persectly finished', properly of works of art.

Cp. Ov. Met. Ι. 405 forma leominis...sea' uti de marmore coepto,
non exacta salis.

74. concinnior ‘better-turned’: the word is properly used
of regular beauty. Ep. 1. 11, 2.

75. ducit ‘carries off‘: but it is not quite clear what the
metaphor is. Bentley thinks it might perhaps be derived from
the notiori of a handsome slave, set at the head of a row offered
sor sale: buthe recognizes the objections to this view, and in-
clines rather to take it as ‘deceives’, with poema as the nomi-
native: it is then necessary to read venit for vendit with one
MS. Sch'utz understands Livius as the subject, and takes
ducit (with some other editors) as ‘produces as a specimen’:
this is very doubtful. It is best to carry on versus as the sub-
ject, and to take ducilztralzit, ‘brings after it ³, either, as
Orelli says, into quarters to which it would not otherwise make
its way, or into the favour of the purchaser. The phrase ducere
familiam (Cic. de· Fin. IV. 16, 48, ad Fam. Vll. 5 accedit quod
familiam ducit in iure civili) ‘to be the first,' might lead usto
regard the phrase here as an extension of that usage.

’ΝΞ-89. It makes me indtgrnant to hear tlze new blamed,
because it is new, tlte old honoured, solely because it is old.
Honest crz'ticz'sm of tlze earlier writers is forbidden owing to seff-
szffcience, salse pride, and ill-will towards contemporaries.
