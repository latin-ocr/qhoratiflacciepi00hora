thehdeed, asmany editors do, sor praesens is naturally contrasted
wit ex ocu Is.

185. ne restored by Bentley sor nec, which seems to have
no authority. It is ἰ’να μή, not μή, as he rightly takes it. In the
Medea of Euripides, the eries of the children, as they are being
murdered behind the scenes, are heard by the audience (vv. 1271,
1277); the chorus tells Jason of their sate (v. 1309), and then
Medea appears in a chariot drawn by dragous, with the bodies
of the children (v. 13¹7)· In Seneca's play, in spite of the
rule of Horace, the murder took place on the stage.

186. Atreus: cp. v. 9¹·

187. Procne, according to the Greek form of the story, was
changed into a nightingale, Philomela, her sister, into a swallow:
the Romans generally made Philomela the nighfingale, and Pro-
cne the swallow, perhaps wrongly connecting the name of the
former 1νίῑ11μέλος. Cp. Wagner and Conington on Verg. Ecl.
VI. 78*9. The legend is most fully given by Ovid Met. VI.
412—676‚ and best discussed by Preller Gr. Myth. 11. 140—144.

cadmus in anguem: cp. M. Arnold Empedocles on Elna:

And there, they say, two bright and aged snakes,
Who once were Cadmus and Harmonia,

Bask in the glens or on the warm sea-shore,

In breathless quiet, aster all their ills.

Cp. Eur. Bacch. 1330 ff. ‘In another play Eur. actually repre-
sented on the stage the commencement of the change, as is shewn
by the following somewhat ludicrous lines, fragm. 922, οἴμοι,
δράκων μοι ’γίγνεται τό ’γ’ ἣμισυ· τέκνον, περιπλάκηθι τῷ λοιπῷ
πατρί. Cp. Ovid Met. 1V. 584, and Milton l). L. lx. 505.'
(Sandys ad loc.)

188. incredulus refers to v. 187, not so much to 185—6.

189-192, Α pla y must be of due length, and tlte inlervenlion
qs a deity must not be necdlessly employed.

189. quinto actu: sor quam quz'nlum actum, the acc. being
an acc. of extent after productior:longior. Greek tragedies were
divided into ἐπεισόδια with a πρόλογος and an ἔξοδος, divided
by choric songs (cp. Aristot. Poet. c. XII. [perhaps an interpola-
tion]) ; but the number of the ἐπεισόδια was not always the same.
In the Oedipus Tyrannus sor instance there are six ‘episodes'‚
with five στάσιμα and a πάροδος (cp. Jebb's edition, p. 8); in
the Oedipus Coloneus there are five. The establishment of the
rule requiring three acts (nam tragoedia z'n tria dividitur, ex-
pectationem, gesta, exitum: Donat. on Ter. Adelph. 111. 1), or
including the prologue and the epilogue five, has been assigned
to Varro (cp. Ribbeck lt'ijm. Trag. p. 642). It was quite un·
known to the comic dramatist53 the division of each of the plays
