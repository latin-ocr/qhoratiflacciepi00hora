43. rides ‘you are laughing at us '. ait ‘ says one' Pers. ῐ.
40 rides, ait. Juv. IX· 6 3 improbus es cnm poscis, ait ε inquil is
more common (cp. Sat. Ι. 4, 793 3, 126; 11. 2, 99), aio being
rarelyused where the speaker’s words are directly quoted: but

cp. Cle-‘Orat’ 11, 36. Verg. however has the construction
severa times.

10v1s=Augusti. Horace never directly applies this name to
the Emperor, as Ovid does without scruple: and in the mouth
of his critics it perhaps carries something of a sneer.

44. manare with a quasi-transitive force, like ῥεῖν.

45. tibi ‘in your own eyes'. naribus uti ‘to sneer at

them openly'. Cp. Sat. Ι. 6, 5 naso suspendis adunco: 11. 8, 64
Balatro suspendens omnia naso. Ep. 1. 5, 23.

46. acuto—ungui: cp. Carm. 1. 6, 18 proelia virginum seclis
z'n iuvenes unguibus acriam. Horace implies that the malice of
his opponents is such that they will stoop to any kind of attack.
Scratching however wus a recognised method of carrying on
combats at Sparta. Cp. Cic. Tusc. V. 27, 77. Pausan. 111.
14, 8.

47. iste locus ‘the place you have chosen': isse has much
more authority here than ille, and is better in itself.

‘diludia dicuntur tempora, quae gladiatoribus conceduntur,

ut intra dies quinque pugnent ’—Acron. The word occurs no-
where else.

48. ludus plays upon diludia: ‘I call for a respite of the
struggle, for a struggle though only in sport’ ete.

EPISTLE XX.

This Epistle is evidently intended as the epilogue to the
First Book. It has been supposed that the reference in vv.
27—-28 fixes beyond dispute the date of the publication of the
book ε but cp. Introduction. The book is humorously addressed
as though it were a young slave, eager to escape from the sase
retirement of his master's house, to see the great city, and to
find himself lovers there, while he is ignorant of the dangers that
await him, and the risk of desertion and neglect, when return
will be impossible. The special intelest sor us lies in the lines
which give so graphic a sketch of Horace's personal appearance
and character.—Ovid in Trist. Ι. 1 addresses his own book in
very similar language. Cp. Mart. Ι. 3.
