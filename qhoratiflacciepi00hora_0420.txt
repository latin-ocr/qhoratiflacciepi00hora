384 ARS POETJCA.

as in the passages quoted by Ernesti Lex. Techn. s.v. μειρα-
κιῶδες to denote ‘affectatio concinnitatis a gravitate virili
aliena '. teneris, osten used of amatory lasciviousness, as Cic. in
Pis. 36, 89 cum tuis teneris saltatoribus, and perhaps in Pers.
1. 35.

247. crepent: Ep. Ι. 7, 84. dicta ‘jests'‚ as so osten in
Cic. (le Orat. ΙΙ., e.g. 54, 221 (note).

248. quibus est equus, i.e. the whole class of equites, who
had a census of more than 400‚000 sesterces, not of course only
the equites equo publico, the 18 centuries iuniorum: the ex-
pression is loose, but intelligible.

pater: only ingenui born in wedlock had a legal father,
hence slaves and freedmen are excluded: cp. Liv. X. 8, 10
patricios primo esse fizctos... qui patrem ciere possent, id est, nilzz't
ultra qzcam ingenuos. But there is no reference to patricians
here, as Ritter thinks.

res, i.e. substantial citIZens.

249. fricti ciceris, still a common article of food in Italy
(cecla friam: cp. Plaut. Bacch. 763; in Plant. Poen. 323 we
have triticum et frictas nuces, which shows that fricti goes also
with niu-is. Nax includes, and probably here specially denotes
‘chestnuts’, castaneae nuces of Verg. Ecl. 11. 52. Martial speaks
of cicer as the cheapest kind of sood, 1. 104, 10 asse cicer tepidum
constat. The Δῆμος κυαμοτρὼξ of Aristoph. Eq. 41 refers not
only to his favourite diet of beans, but also to the use of thern in
the ballot.

250. aequis...animis ‘with favour’, as in Verg. Aen. IV.
372 llaec oculis Pater aspicit aequis, VI. 1²9 quos aequus amavit
lujgzbiten and osten. Orelli wrongly ignores this use.

251—274. T lte z'ambic metre used in tragedy must be ltandlccz'
witlz great care, ami tlte Greek moctels, not tlte mugla Latin
tragediam are to be imitated.

251. iambus v. 79 (note). The elementary character of “
the information here given is probably intended as a modest
introduction to the advice which Horace thought it needful to
give to the Pisones, who may have shown tendeneies to negli-
gence in the matter of metre.

252. unde...1ambei⁴.=.. Porphyrion explains the connexion
thus : ‘Omnes versus tragici trimetri appellantur. Quaeri autern
solet cur trimetri appellentur, cum senos accipiant pedes. Quo-
niam scilicet tanto brevitas est pedum, ut iuncturae binos eom-
plectantur pedes’. This explanation seems to justify us in
keeping to the MSS„ which have no variation, except that a
few have accedere for accrescere, which is doubtless only a gloss.
