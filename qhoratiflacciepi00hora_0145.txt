9. Titius may possibly have been a son of M. Titius, the
consul suffectus in the year of the battle at Actium, where
he held a high command. The account given by the scholiasts
does not add much to our knowledge : Acron says that he tried
to transfer the profound thought and eloquence of Pindar into
Latin, and wrote tragedies and lyrics. of little value: Porphyrion
adds that he was very learned. All this may well be derived
from the text. The Comm. Cruq. says that his name was Titius
Septimius, and that there was a remarkable monument to him
below Aricia z the first part of this statement cannot be right, for
we have no instance as early as this of the combination of two
gentile names, like Titius and Septimius. Cp. note on Ep. 1.
9, 1. Horace does not appear to be ‘deriding' him, but com—
bines with the expression of his belief that Rome ⁴ would hear of
him before long', a gentle warning against too high-flown a style.

rowed doubtless from the phrase in the epitaph written by Ennius
sor himself volito vivus per ora virum (Cic. Tusc. 1. 15, 34). It
is quite perverse to assume that the phrase has a bad meaning
here, as in Catull. XL. 5.

the easier styles of poetry‚ The contrast is between the fresh
