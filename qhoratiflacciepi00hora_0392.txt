356 ΑΕΒ POETJCA.

102. dolendum est : Acron here quotes ‘illud Ciceronis
ardeat orator, si vult iudicem incendere', apparently an inaccu-
rate reminiscence of Cic. (le Orat. 11. 45, 189, 190. Porphyrion
quotes a story of Demosthenes (leelining to plead the cause of a
man who said he had been beaten, because he told the story with-
out any emotion, and only undertaking the case when the man
repeated the tale of his wrongs for the third time, with tears of
indignation.

104. male mandata go together, and are an instance of the
idion] noticed on Ep. 11. 2, 166, where the participle really
expresses the main proposition: ‘if the words which you utter
are ill assigned to you', i.e. unsuited to your position and
emotions.

105. maestum ‘dejected’‚ almost always of an outward
expression of grief: hence dolor and maeror are contrasted in
Cic. Ep. Att. X11.28, Phil. XI. 1. Cp. Doederlein Syn. 111. ²34·

107. lasciva. ‘ sportive'‚ with no evil connotatIOn. The word
is usgd ten times6by Horace, and never in a distinctly bad sense :
cp. p. 11. 2, 21 .

severum seria: ‘inter serius et severus hoc discriminis est,
ut prius sere semper dicitur de rebus, posterius de hominibus’.
Ruhnken on Ter. Eun, 111. 3, 7 (513)—az't velle agere mecum
rem sermm.

109. iuvat ‘gladdens’, rare in this sense as a personal verb ;
and perhaps only here with a person not a. thing as the subject:
cp. carm. 1. 1, ‘23 mullos castra iuvant.

habitum=k¹gw or σχῆμα. ‘ condition’.

111. motus probably never, even in poetry, used without
animi for ‘ emotion '.

interprete lingua, ‘by the agency of the tongue’. The
ἓϊίἓίὔιὲ of the word is very doubtful: cp. Curtius, Gr. Etym.⁵

113. equites peditesque, ‘one and all' srom the highest to
the lowest. Bentley objects (1) that the phrase is never used to
cover the whole people, except with a distinctly military refer-
ence, or as in Liv. 1. 44 edixit ut omnes cives Romani, equites
peditesque, z'n suis quisque centuriis in campo lisartio adessent:
(2) that Horace professes elsewhere to care only sor the judgment
of the educated (cp. Sat. 1. 10, 76 satis est equitem milziplaudere):
and therefore bids us read equitesque patresque ⁴ librariorum populo
valereriussol This reading receives some support from Mart.
XIV. 120, where the phrase is used of the educated as opposed to
the unlearned ε Quamvis me ligulam dicant equitesque patresque,
