NOTES. 3 31

inclined to look sor other indications of an earlier date, which
would show that the statement of Porphyrion is erroneous.
These indications have been put together in an excellent paper
by A. Michaelis (Commentationcs in honorem Theodori lllomm-
seni, Berlin 1877, pp. 420—432), and supplemented by Prof.
Nettleship in the Journal cffPlzz’lon, Vol. XII. pp. 43—61.

(Ι) P. (not, as commonly given, Spurius: cp. Jordan in
Hermes V111. 89 f.) Maecius Tarpa is mentioned in v. 387 as a
critic whose judgment would be of value to a young composer.
Now in B.C. 55 Maecius was entrusted by Pompeius with the
superintendence of the plays and other spectacles‚ which were
to be produced in the stone theatre, which he had just built.
It is indeed conceivable that at that time he was not more than
30 years of age, and that in Β. C. 8 he was still living at the age
of 77; but it is much easier to understand the reference, isit
was made some ten or twelve years earlier. Horace mentions
him as a critic of plays in Sat. Ι. 10, 38, but the date of this is
probably about B.C. 35.

(2) In v. 371 Aulus Cascellius is mentioned as a type of a
learned lawyer, in connexion with Messalla, who is a type of
eloquence. The language used indicates that both were living,
and certainly Messalla was. But Cascellius was already famous
in B.C. 56; and although he reached old age, it is barely pos-
sible that he was living in B.C. 8. (Macrob. 11. 6, 1, Val. Max.
Vl. 2, 12.) ,

(3) On the other hand in v. 438 Quintilius Varus is spoken
of in a manner which implies that he was dead at the time.
But the terms of the reference suggest that he had been known
to the young Pisos‚ and was not long dead. Now Eusebius (in
Jerome's translation) assigns his death to Β. C. 24 (cp. Carm. 1.
24, 5), and there is no reason to doubt this statement.

(4) The reference to Vergil and Varius in v. 55 is much
more appropriate, if we suppose them both to be living, or at
any rate, if we suppose the Aeneid to have been very recently
published. Horace is evidently contending for a right which
was disputed by the critics of his time, and in the thick of the
battle: he is defending the school to which he himself, as well
as Vergil and Varius, was attached against criticisms like those
of Agrippa (Suet. Vit. Verg. 44: cp. Nettleship in Conington’s
Vergil, Vol. Ι.4 p. xxix.). But in the latest years of his life the
‘Augustan ’ school of poetry had already won a decisive victory,
and its leading writers were recognized as classic models. There
was no longer need for the warin and strenuous pleading for
that freedoni in dealing with language, which was now gene-
rally conceded: it was sufficient to assert it quietly in the tone
opr. 11. 2, 115 ff.

(5) Horace‘s tone in speaking of himself points to the earlier
rather than to the later date. There is no reference to his advanc·
