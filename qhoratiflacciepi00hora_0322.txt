videndis artibus: Sch'utz is perhaps right in taking the case
to be the dative; but he is not correct in saying that with the
ablative z'lz would have been required3 Dr'ager 11². 849, 850
gives many instanees in which the gerundive is used in the
ablative‚ much as here: videre is used with an extended force:
visu aestimare or videndo diiudicare. If however we accept
Overbeck’s view that Alexander's restriction only extended to
his own comniissions. we may perhaps interpret videre as ‘pro-

Munro on Carni. 1. 20, 10.

sing., as some have supposed. The dull, heavy air of Boeotia is
osten contrasted with that enjoyed by the Athenium, who were αἰεὶ
διὰ λαμπροτάτου βαίνοντες ἁβρῶς αἰθέρος (Eur. Med. 829)1 cp. Cic.

evenerit, etc., where Prof. Mayor quotes Strabo (ΙΙ. 3, p. 102 ff.)
as attacking Posidonius sor maintaining this doctrine: οὐ ’γὰρ
φύσει Ἀθηναῖοι μὲν φιλόλογοι, Λακεδαιμόνιοι δὲ οὒ καὶ οἱ ἐγγυτέρω
Θηβαῖοι, ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον ἔθει. So Juvenal X. 50 quotes Democritus
as a proof summos posse viros ct magna exempla daturos vcr-
vccum in patria crassoque sub aere nasci : cp. Mayor⁷s note for
other instances of the influence of climate on the mental and
moral character. ‘Instead ofthe pure and transparent atmosphere,
which is one of the chief characteristics of the Attie climate,
the air of Boeotia is thick and heavy in consequence of the
vapours arising from the valleys and lakes’. Dict. Geogr. Ι.
414 a. Cp. Wordsworth’s Αἰήτης ancl Attica, p. 241. Pindar.
Ol. VI. 152 speaks jestingly of the proverbial Βοιωτία ὓς, and
Cratinus called the Boeotians Συοβοιωτοί. For the tense of

245. dedecorant: the subjects vergilius variusque are
transferred, as osten, to the relative clause.

246. munera, i.e. the gists which the poets had received
from Augustus: Acron here says that each had already received
from him 1‚000‚000 sesterces. There is no other authority for this
sum; but at his death in ss.C. 19—some years before the date of
this Epistle—Vergil's fortune is said to have amounted to
10‚000,000 sesterces, rnostly if not entirely due to the bounty of
patrons. Varius was apparently older than Vergil, but survived
him and was one of his literary executors: there is nothing to
