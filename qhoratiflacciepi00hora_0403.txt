No TES. 367

168. commisisse ε v. 98 note. mox: postea, as Servius notes
on Georg. 1. 24, quoting Carm. 111. 6, 47 mox daturos progeniem
vitiosiorem. The explanation post, written over mox, has given
rise in sorne inferior MSS. to the reading permutare, probably
from a misunderstanding of the abbreviation p’mutare.

’ 169. vel—vel ‘both—and', used where both reasons might
be eorrectly alleged. Cic. de Orat. 1. 1, 3 note.

170. quaerit: cp. Ep. Ι. 7, 57: Ar. 1. c. πρὸς τὸ συμφέρον
ζῶσιν (oz πρεσβύτεροι), ἀλλ’ οὑ πρὸς τὸ καλόν, μᾶλλον ἥ δεῖ, διὰ τὸ
φίλαυτοι εἶναι...οὔτ’ ἑπιθυμητικοὶ οὔτε πρακτικοὶ κατὰ τὰς ἐπιθυμίας,
ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὸ κέρδος. ‘Aristotle as well as Horace confines him-
self almost exclusively to the delineation of the unfavourable
side of the character of old age, suppressing its ,redeeming
features? Cope ad loc.

1⁷1. gelide: Ar. κατεψυγμένοι ’γάρ εἰσιν, οἱ δὲ (νέοι) θερμοί.
gxi προωδοποίηκε τὸ ’γῆρας τῇ δειλίᾳ· καὶ γὰρ ὁ φόβος κατάψυξίς τις

172. spe longus: Aristotle describes old rnen as δυσέλ-
πιδας, i.e. slow to form h0pe5‚, and this seems to be the meaning
required here. But can spe longus bear that meaning? There
is no other instance of the phrase z but spes longa is used several
times by Horace to denote ‘ a far-reaching hope'‚ a hope which
requires much time for its sulfilment, cp. Carm. 1. 4, 15 vitae
summa brevis spem nos velat incohare longam : ib. 1. 11, 6 spatio
brevi spem longam reseces. But the hopes of old men are
necessarily short in their anticipations, and so spe longus seems
to give just the wrong meaning. Hence Bentley read spe
lentus, which he took to mean ‘slow to conceive hopes'. But it
is very doubtful whether this could mean anything but ‘ tenacions
of hope', and hence it amounts to the same thing as spe longus
in his interpretation of the latter. The MS. reading may how-
ever lawsully bear the meaning ‘holding long to his hopes',
that is to say, not expecting the speedy sulfilment of them, as a
young man does, and therefore not pushing on strenuously (iners)
to realise them. Much as Horace borrows here from Aristode,
it is not necessary to suppose that he follows him in every point:
Cic. Fam. 11. 16, 6 has recordor desperan'ones corum, qui senes
erant adulescente me: eos ego fortasse nunc imitor et utor aetatis
vitio: but this only shows the possibility, not the necessity of a
similar idea in Horace. Orelli and L. S. retain the explanation
of Forcellini ‘tardus et difficilis ad sperandum’, without meeting
the grave difficulties raised by Bentley.

avidusque futuri is a not less difficult expression: Bentley,
to make Horace reproduce Ar.’s καὶ δειλοὶ καὶ πάντα προφο-
βητικοί, read, on quite worthless authority, pavidusque: but the
poet has in view rather καὶ φιλόζωοι καὶ μάλιστα ἐπὶ τῇ τελευταίᾳ
