rent. Epicharmus was born in Cos about B.C. 540, but was
brought as an infant to Megara in Sicily, and enjoyed much repu-
tatiou at the court of Hiero in Syracuse about B.C. 490. He is
said to have reached a great age.

59. Caecilius Statius, an Insubrian Gaul by birth, flourished
at Rome at the same time as Ennius, dying one year aster him in
B.C. 168. He was placed at the head of all the Roman comic
poets by Volcatius Sedigitus (a critic quoted by A. Gellius XV.

facile exsuperat ceteros, etc. while Terence only comes sixth in
his list. He is osten quoted by Cicero, who however censures
his bad style (Brut. 74, 258, ad Att. V11. 3, ιο), and was distin-
guished especially sor skill in the management of his plots.
Nonius (p. 374) quotes Varro as saying ln argumentis Caecilius
poscit palmam, in ethesz' Terentius, in sermonibus Plautus. His
gravitas seems to have been shown in his sententious maxims
(Sellar, p. 702). The ‘art' of Terence appears in the caresut
finish of his style. Cp. Caesar's lines quoted by Sueton. Vit.

nis amalor.

are the private recitation-halls: here they are the public theatres‚
of which there were three permanent ones in Rome at this time,
one built by Cn. Pompeius in B.C. 55 near the Circus Flaminius,
one built by Augustus in honour of Marcellus (not finished
however until B. C. 1 1), important remains of which are still stand-
ing near the Tarpeian Hill, and a third built by Cornelius
Balbus between the other two. It had previously been the
custom to perform plays in temporary wooden theatres‚ often of
great magnificence.

61. potem, so mighty, and yet so wanting in critical dis-
cernment. The strange lack of great dramatists or poets of any -
kind in the half century preceding Lucretius and Catullus seems
due partly to the ‘ separation in taste and sympathy between the
higher classes and the mass of the people ’ (Sellar, p. 265) which
made literature the amusement of a narrow circle, and partly to
the disturbed political conditions of the time. The continued
popularity of the old tragedians may be ascribed to the extent to
which they represented some of the best features in the old
Roman character (ib. p. 151).

62. Livi: Livius Andronicus, who in B.c. ¹240 first brought
upon the stage a Latin translation of a Greek tragedy.
