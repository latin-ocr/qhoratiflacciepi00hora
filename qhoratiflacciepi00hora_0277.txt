Bk. Ι. Ep. XX] NOTES. 241

to ‘hot' or to ‘cold'i’ As the word properly denotes a mild
warmth, it is found sometimes in one sense, sometimes in the
other, but the former is much the more common: cp. however
Ep. Ι. 18, 93. In Carm. 11. 6, 17 tepidasque praebet Iuppiter
brumas and Sat. 11. 3, 10 si vacuum tepido cepisse! villula tecto,
the notion suggested is that of a comsortable warnith : in Sat. 1.
3, 81 tepidmn ius is ‘sauce half-cold’. The same force attaches
to tepeo in Sat. Ι. 4, 30 (sol) quo vespertina tepet rigia, and in Ep.
1. 10, 15 est ubi plus tepeant hiemes: and apparently also in
Carni. 1. 4, 20 where tepebunt is a weaker word than the pre-
ceding calet. Hence we must decidedly reject Maeleane's ‘heat
of the day' and Conington’s ‘summer asternoons', and find
some time when the sun has already lost something of its heat.
Orelli argues for the time towards evening‚ quoting Mart. IV. 8,
7 hora libellorum decima est, Eupheme, meorum: (we may add
Mart. X. 19, 18 seras tutior ibis acl lacernas. Haec lzora est tua,
cum furit Lyaeus, cum regnat rosa, cnm madent capilli,) sup-
posing that Horace's ‘benevoli lectores’, after scattering to their
houses for dinner, would gather again to listen to his bbook re-
citing the poems it contained. But Martialis intentionally dis-
paraging his own epigrams, when he repiesents them as only fit
for the after· dinner amusement of revelle1·‚s and there is no
reason to suppose that evening was the time usually chosen for
public recitations. 1f we accept this interpretation of sol lepidus
it is better to think, with KrUger, of the loiterers round the shop
of the Sosii, who would be more numerous in the evening than
at any other time: cp. Horace⁷s description of his own practice
in Sat. Ι. 6, 113. There is plenty of authority for this use of sol
as marking a part o'f the day: cp. Sat. 1. 4, 30: Sat. Ι. 6, 125:
Sat. 11. 4, 23. But others suppose that Horace is still regarding
his book as a schoolmaster; and that sol tepidus refers to the
cooler days aster the holidays (Sat-1. 6, 75, with Palmer s note),
when the schools would be full again; or, as some again say,
to the milder weather after the spring liolidays. In that case he
would be giving a gloomy prophecy that few but schoolboys
would read his poenis. This is barely 1n keeping with the tone
of the following part of the letter, which is much better fitted
to be addressed to the general public than to boys using the
poems as a first reading-book. The scholiasts were fairly
puzzled by the line, and write sheer nonsense. Comm. Cruq.
has‘ cum plures coeperint te legere et audire. secundum morem
librariorum loquitur, qui circa quartam vel quintam horam
dictata pueris praebere consueverunt, quo tempore sunt t, acta
bc'lt'ores’. Another has‘ tunc enim dictata accipiunt pueri, cum
beneficio solis cera facilius deletur’ . But why in either case
plures? Another explains sol tepidus as popularis favor. Per-
haps the simplest explanation after all is Ritter's‚ who takes
it to mean ‘when the weather is neither too hot nor too cold
