284 ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE.

233. Choerilus. There were three well-known poets of this
name. (1) Choerilus of Athens, one os the earliest tragic poets,
who produced many plays between B.C. 523 and B.C. 483: (2) C.
of Samos, the composer of an epic poem on the Persian wars, a
younger contemporary and friend of Herodotus: (3) C. of Iasos,
also an epic poet, but of a very inferior kind, who followed
Alexander to Asia. This last is the one here meant: in A. P.
357 he is taken as the type of a poet who sometimes ‘deviates
into' excellence. Acron here says that he had only seven good
lines in his poem on the exploits of Alexander, for each of
which he received a gold piece. On A. P. 357 he adds that
Alexander had bargained to give him this reward, on condition
that the bard should receive a blow for eveiy bad verse, and
that he died of the blows. The king is reported to have said
malle se Thersiten Homeri esse quam Choerili Achillem, which
does not look as if he was so bad a judge of poetry as Horace
represents him to have been. Alexander was not only the pupil
of Aristotle, but also himself an enthusiastic student of Homer:
possibly, as Schiitz thinks, Horace’s low estimate of his critical
powers was simply due to the fact that there was no good
poem extant of which he was the theme.

incultis et male natis ‘rough and misbegotten’: versibus is
dative, as in Ovid, Trist. 11. 10 acceptum restro versibus esse nocens.

234. rettulit acceptos ‘set down to the credit of’: acceptum
rcfirre is the regular phrase for to enter on the receipt side of
accounts, opposed to expensum serre: cp. Cic. Phil. 11. 16, 40
egro enim amplius sestertium ducentiens acceptum hereditatibus
rettuli.

regale. The right of coining gold was always reserved to
themselves by the kings of Macedon, as by the kings of Persia
and afterwards by the Romans: while subject states and dis-
tricts were often permitted to coin silver (cp. Gardner’s Greek
Ceius, p. 26): and there may probably be a reference to this
here: cp. our sovereign, and δαρεικὸς, which is apparently derived
not from Darius, but from the Persian dard, ‘ king'. The coins
of Philip had on one side a head of Ares, on the other a chariot,
not as some editors say the king's head (Gardnen p. 188). There
is no instance of a realistic portrait of an earlier time than
Alexander (ib. p. 175).

nomisma3 this is the earliest instance in which this purely
Greek word occurs in Latin: Martial has it several times.

Philippos: the Philippus or Phih'ppens (with or without num-
mus) was a gold piece, coined by Philip II. of Macedon to replace
the Persian daries, which had up to his time been the gold
coinage most widely current in Greece, probably as a preparation
