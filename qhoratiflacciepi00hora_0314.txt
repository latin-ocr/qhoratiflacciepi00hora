178. lentus ‘indifferent', ‘irresponsive'; cp. lentissima brac·
chia in Sat. 1. 9, 64.

infiat ‘inspires ⁹, almost equivalent to reficit below. There
does not seem to be any suggestion of pride here, any more than
in Cic. in Pis. 36, 89 cum tibi spe sizlsa...animos rumor z'n-
flasset.

lisoi. aut : Bentley's ac has very slight authority, and is not
11661 e( .

valeat. ‘ no more of !’ or ‘good-bye to’: res ludicra, i. e.
the drama. So we have parles ludicras „tustinum-mit in Suet.
Ner. 11, and qui arlem ludicram sinizmi‘ is a jurist's term sor
aetors.

181. macrum-opimum, with a humorous exaggeration sorv
‘ depressed’ and ι11”111111ρ11ε1111’.

182. audacem, i. 6, the poet who is bold enough to run
the risk of sailure from popular indifference.

184. depugnare, stronger than Orelli's manus intentare.-
rather ‘to fight it out ⁵.

185. eques: the knights, i. e. the wealthier and better
educated part of the audience (cp. note on Ep. 1. 1, 62), would
naturally differ in their tastes from the mass of the spectators.
Cp. Sat. 1. 10, 76 satis est equitem miln‘ plaudere, ut audax,
mnic7nptis aliis, mylasa Arbuscula dixit. A. P. 113, 248.

media. inter carmina: Terence (Hecyr. Prol. Ι. 1-5, and
ΙΙ, 25—34) pathetically complains that the first time his Hecyra
was acted the audienee went off to see a rope-dancer, and 1116
second time they deserted him in order to get good places at a
gladiatorial show. carmen is used of a tragedy in A. P. 220,
and includes dramatic poetry in v. 69. ep. Tac. Ann. Χι. 13
is carmina scaenae dabat.

186. ursum: bears were brought in to fight with mastiffs
(molossi): forty bears were baited 111 1116 circus at the games
given by the aediles in ΒΕ. 169 (Liv. XLIV. 18›: one hundred
at the games in ΒΩ. 61 (Ptin. H. N. VIII. 363 131). Sometimes
tame bears were shown (Mart. 1. 105, 5).

pugiles ‘boxers’, were a favourite sight with Augustus:
Suet. Oct. XLV. speclavit studiosissime pugiles, et maxime
Latinos.

gaudet ε 50 1116 vet. Bland. and 011161 good MSS. The first
letter having become obliterated in some copies, plaudet was
written by conjecture, and appears in many MSS. The tense
being evidently wrong, subsequent copyists wrote plaudit, which
is found only in inferior MSS. Orelli's pleading for plaudit is
very weak.
