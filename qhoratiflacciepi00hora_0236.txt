200 ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE.

in Shakspere, 1.e.‚ ‘we have the receipt of feru-seed, we wall<
invisible')‚ a derivation accepted by Donaldson on the strength of
the more than doubtful identity of Lamnus and Latinus. Acron
connects the word with lavare, thicves being called lavatores, 1
suppose, because they ‘clean out' travellers. But the only legi-
timate derivation is frorn the root ln or lau ‘to gain', found in
ἀπο-λαὺ-ω, ληΐς, lucrum, latro, etc. (Curt. Gr. Elym. No. 536).
Arnobius IV. 24 says of Laverna, cum Mercurio simul fraudibus
praesidet furtivis. Preller, Ram. lllytlz. p. 218 (ep. p. 459) con-
siders Lavernae a bye-form of Lara (the Dea Μαίη and Mater
Larum), a goddess of the dari< and silent under-world, and hence
the patroness of thieves (as St Nicholas is said to have acquired
his functions from a confusion with ‘ Old Nick’), but this does
not account satisfactorily for the form of the word.

61. da. with inf„ as dones in Carm. 1. 31, 17.

iusto sanctoque restored by Bentley from the vet. Bland. and
other good MSS. for the old reading iustum sanctumque, which
is only a copyist⁷s alteration: cp. Sat. Ι, 1, 19 alqui licet esse
beatis, Ι. 6, 25 fierique tribuno. Cp. Roby ἓ 1357, S. G.
ἓ 537 (c)-

62. obice : the form obiice is found in no good MS. here, or
in Carm. ΙΙΙ. 10⁷ 3. Roby§ 144.

63—72. One who z’s α slave 2⁴0 leis haser passz'ons z's no five
man, lmt should be treated as a comm-<ily prisoner (gf war, and set
to some use->fill teil.

63. qui ‘how't Ep. 1. 6, 42; Sat. 11. 2, 19; 3, 241, 260,
275, 311, etc.

64. in triviis fixum: repeated by Pers. V. 111 inque luto
fixum possis transcmm'ssre nummum, where the scholiast says that
it was a common joke with boys at Rome to solder a coin to the
paveinent (assem in silice plmnbatum z'Jfigere> in order to ridi-
cule those who stooped to pick it up, crying ‘try again !’ Schiitz
considers this a forced explanation, and takes fixum as ‘stick-
ing', somewhat as in Sat. 11. 3, 294. The exaggerated phrase of
Petronius c. XLIII. ab asse crevit et paratus fuit quadrantem de
stercore mordicus tollere rather points to this view.

66. mihi ‘in my eyes’ Roby§ 1148, S. G. ξ 477.

67. perdidit, arma, i.e. is a ῥίψασπις, a coward who has
flung away his arms, Bentley showed that this phrase was quite
the correct one : ‘prodere enim signa publica recte dixeris: pri-
vata cuiusque arma non item: sed tradere arma, proicere, abicere,
amittere, perdere’. Cp. Plaut. Epid. 55 (Goetz) εἰ] me perdidit.
quis? illc qui arma perdidit.
