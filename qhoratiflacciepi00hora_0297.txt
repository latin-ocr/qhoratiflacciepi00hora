Bk. 11. Ep. 1.] NOTES. 261

w. quicquam: used where we might have expected ali-
quid, because indignor :ferre mm possum, and is thus virtually
negative. Cp. Madvig Gr. ἓ 494 b, and note on Cic. Cat. 1. 2, 6
quamdiu quisquam crit. . vives.

reprehentu: Keller asserts that the contracted sorm reprendi,
preferred here and iu vv. 81, ἰη by some editors, does not
occur before the middle of the tenth century Α.ι)., and that the
archetype certainly had reprehendi. Mr Munro thinks that
Horace ‘perhaps always wrote reprendere sor reprehendere os
MSS. as twice he certainly did‘. But it is to be noticed that in
both these cases (Sat. 11. 10, 55, Ep. 1. 18, 39) rapt-end· has the
short vowel.

crasse ‘coarsely’: crassa lllinetvcz in Sat. 11. 2, 3 ‘home-
spun mother wit’. The opposite is tenui filo in v. ²²5· Cic.
ad Fam. lx. 12, 2 calls his speech sor Deiotarus munusculum

levidense crasso filo.

⁹17. putetur: Roby ἓ 1744, S. G. ἓ 740, α. The subjunctive
does not depend here upon the non qnod, as contrasted with the
scd quia, but it is equally to be understood aster the latter, as

expressing the alleged reason sor the censure.

79. crocum: flowers were strewn upon the stage, and
saffron juice sprinkled upon it, for the sake of the fragrance:
cp. Lucr. ΙΙ. 416 et cum scaena croco Cilici perfusa recens est .·
Ον. Art. Am. 1. ‘104 nec fuerant liquida pulpita rubra croco:
Plin. N. H. XXI. 6, 33 vino mire congruit [crocumL praeciptle
dulci, tritum ad theatra replenda .· Sall. Hist. 11. 29 croco s‘ptzrsa
humus. The masculine form is generally used for the plant,
the neuter sor the expressed juice3 hence the word here is pro·
bably neuter: but the distinction is not always observed.

Attae. T. Quinctius Atta was a writer of comoediae togulae,
who died according to Jeronie on Euseb. Chron. in ΗΟ. 78. His
fragments (cp. Ribbeck Com. Lat. pp. 160—164) abound in
archaisms, but are vigorous in style. Cp. Teuffel Rom. Lit.
§ ηο- The cognomen is explained by Fest. s. v. p. 12 (Miiller)
as proper to those qui propter vitium crurum aut pedum plantis
insz'stunl et attingunt magis terram quam ambulant, not differing
therefore much from Plautus. Some have not unnaturally supposed
that there is a reference to this in perambulal; but undoubtedly
the primary meaning of this is explained aright by Acron: in
scenam recepta est, ubi flores sparguntur. Porphyrion has a
curious notion that it refers to the undue length at which in a
play called Alaterlera he went through the names os the various

kinds of flowers.

81. patres ‘ elders ' as in v. 109.
