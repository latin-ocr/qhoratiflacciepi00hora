have been those at Clusium: but as Heyne justly observes
‘habuit autern et olim et nunc Etruria aquas salubres pluribus
loeis'. Besides those were clearly hot baths‚ while the springs
at Clusium were cold-

Gabios: Ep. 1. 11, 7: Strabo V. 3 ἐν δὲ τῷ πεδίῳ τούτῳ ὁ
Ἀνίων διέξεισι καὶ τὰ Ἀλβουλα καλούμενα ῥεῖ ὕδατα ψυχρὰ ἐκ
πολλῶν πηγῶν, πρὸς ποικίλας νόσους καὶ πίνουσι καὶ ἐγκαθημένοις
ὑγιεινά. In Juv. VII. 4 cum iam celebres notique poetae balneolum
Gabiis conducere temptarent Prof. Mayor thinks the point to be
that in so small a place but little custom could be expected.
But there are indications that owing to its cold baths it to some
extent recovered its prosperity: cf. Burn’s Rome and tlte Cam-

pagna p. 382.

10. nota, sc. equo. The horse wanted to turn down to the
right, as usual, where the road branched off, and led through
Cumae to Baiae. This was apparently at Capua: the via
Domitiana, which led straight from Sinuessa to Cumae along
the coast, was made by the Emperor Domitian (Stat. Silv. 1v. 3):
Orelli is misleading here.

12. stomachosus habena ‘ pulling angrily at the rein ’z habena
is the ablative of instrument; ‘venting his anger with’. Habencz

ihs ¹sffiictly a single strap or rein; hence usually in the plural of a
ri e.

13. sed, i.e. but it is no good saying anything, for &c.

equis: the singular equi, according to Keller, has more
authority ε but Bentley seems right in regarding this clause as a
general reflexion, in which case the dative, as he has shown,
is the case required. equi must then be regarded as wrongly
assimilated to eques.

14. populum, not an uncommon expression for the inhabi-
tants of a municz'pizmz: cp. Wilmanns Ex. Inscr. Lat. 1194,

1219 a, 1804, 1809, &c., where we have S. P. Q. T. of Tibur.
15. conectos...1mbres, i.e. in tanks (lacus).

16. iugis might seem redundant aster perenms: hence some
editors have read dulcis, the reading of the vet. Bland. and a few
other MSS. But, as Bentley saw, dulcis is here out of place:
rain-water is not less dulcis, i.e. not more salt or bitter‚ than
spring-water. We have therefore here another instance of an
attempt at emendation in the vet. Bland., which though at first
sight attractive, will not bear examination. The pleonasm is not
offensive or unparalleled: cp. Ep. 1. 7, 42, Cic. de Or. 111. 48, 184
perennis etprofluens. Bentley quotes from Arnobius perpetuae et
iuges calamitates: iugiter et perpetuo is a law-term, and Doederlein
(Syn. 1. 10) thinks that iuge and perenne auspicium ate the
