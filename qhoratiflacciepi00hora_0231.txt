Bk. 1. Ep. XV1.] NOTES 195

31—40. T lte pleasnre naturally derived from a repulalionfitr
virtue rests on no sure basis: and mgfounded praise is as worthless
as groundless blame.

31. sodes: Ep. Ι. 1, 62 (note). respondesne: Schiitz argues
that -ne must here, as in Ep. Ι. 17, 38, and as so osten in Plautus Α
and Terence‚—in Cicero only in videsne eto—have the force
of nonne, the fact being assumed that it is so. This seems to be
right, cumpateris being ‘in allowing yourself to be' etc. (Roby ξ
1729, S. G. ἓ 731). The metaphor is derived from a levy or a
census, where the citizen answerS, when he hears his own name
called. Cp. Liv. 111. 41 edicitur dilectus: iuniores acl nomina
respondent.

I dnextnqe admits the justice of the implied assertion: ‘to be sure
0, or etc.

33. qul sc. populus.

34. indigno sc. cuz' defi-ranturflzsces. detrahet has some-
what better support than detrahit. The illustration is not very
suitable: for the abrogatio imperii, although theoretically pos-
sible, was exceedingly rare. Cp. Mommsen Rom. Staatsr. ΙΞ

606—609.

35. pone=depone: Carm. 111. ¹2, 19 nec sumit aut ponit
secures arbitrio popularis aurae. The object ofpone is, as Bentley
saw, hoc, i.e. nomen viri boni etprudentz's,· the intervening men-
tion of the fasces, being thrown in parenthetically by way of
comparison, is no sufficient objection to this view, as Schiitz
argues. If we take fasces as the object, we are compelled to give
a forced meaning to meum, ‘it is my prerogative to give and to
take away offices’: besides, we lose the contrast between trz'stz's
and delector.

pono: Horace uses the first person here only in order to
avoid the apparent invidiousness of the second. The fact that
he himself never stood for any office conferred by popular
election, thus does not at all come into the question.

36. idem. Bentley argued that this must be of the first
person, connecting it with mordear, and putting a full stop, not
a note of interrogation, at colores. His notion of the drist of the
passage is z—if Ι am elated by praise which 1 do not deserve, I
should also be stung by charges however groundless. He rightly
sees that the salsus lzonor and the mendax infamia affect the
same man. But Horace's point seems rather to be that as false
charges would not affect the man, in whose position he is sor the
moment placing himself, so an unfounded re'putation sor virtue
ought not to delight him. Hence idem is best taken with·
clamet, of the populus. ·
