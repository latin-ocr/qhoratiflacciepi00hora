84 HORA TI EPISTULAE.

personet, with an acc. here, as in Cic. Ep. Fam. vl. ¹8,
1. Verg. Aen. Vl. 417: but absolutely in Sat. 11. 6, 115.

8. sanus = si sapis.

9. peccet ‘break down'. flia ducat ‘strain his panting
flanks’: ilia ducere is the same as ilia tendere in Verg. G. 111.
506 (not, as Macleane, the reverse): cp. Aen. IX. 4¹3 longis
singultibus ilia pulsat: Plin. N. H. XXVI. 6, 15 iumentz's...n0n
tussientibus modo sed ilia quoque trahentibus: all these phrases
mean ⁴ to become broken-winded.’

10. itaque, not found in the second place in a sentence in
prosegbesore Livy. Cp. Hand Turs.111. 509, Kiihnast Liv. Synt.
p. 31 .

ludicra ‘toys’‚ i.e. trifles (Ep. 1. 6, 7), but not, as Macleane,
‘follies³. ponozdepono, as sometimes even in Cicero, eg. de
Orat. 111. 12, 46, de Off. 111. 10, 43; Tusc. 1. 11, 24 (Kiihner),
and osten, especially with arma, in Livy.

11. quid. verum sc. sit, a rare omission in prose: cp. Cic.
de Off. Ι.43, 152 (Holden). Madvig ξ 479 a, obs. For vmumz
‘right' τὸ πρέπονε cp. Ep. Ι. 12, 24; Sat.11. 3, 312: zdne est
vemm Ter. Andr. 629. It is not so inuch speculative as moral
truth of which Horace 1s in quest.

omnis in hoc sum ‘ I am wholly absorbed in this’ z cp. Sat.
1. 9, 2 totus in z'llz's.

12. condo et, compono ‘ Ι stote up and arrange ⁹, so as to be
able to produce at once, like a good condus promus.

13. ne forte roges: Roby ξ 1662, S.G. ἓ 690; Ep. 11. 1,
203 ac we fhrte putes. Although Maecenas was doubtless aware
of Horace's independent position, this is not a sufficient reason
to suppose that there is here a change of subject to the reader in
general.

quo...tuter ‘ who is my leader, and what the home in which
I find shelter '.

dux=head of a school : Quint. V. 13, 59 dues diversarum
sectarum quasi duces. The terms domus and familz'cz'were often
used of a philosophie school (eg. de Orat. 1. 10, 42, ΠΙ. 16, 21):
hence the transition to ίαν, properly the household god, is natural.

14. addictus, at least as strongly supported by MS. authority
as adductus, and unquestionably the right reading here3 for the
metaphor of the gladiatorial school is still retained: cp. Petron.
