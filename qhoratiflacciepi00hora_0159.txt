16—20. W ine has wonderful power lo open tlte Ιιεανί, lo raise
tlze spirits and to qm'ckm llze wils.

16. dissignat, unquestionably the right reading, though
Macleane does not even notice it, both as being better supported,
and as the rarer word, and so more lil-ely to be corrupted. Dis-
szgnare is properly ‘to breal- the seal’, hence to open':
it is rightly explained by‘ aperitss in Porphyrion s note. Prof.
Nettleship (Journal οβΡΙ11ίοίοξζι1, Χ. 206— δ) is of opinion that
the word had acquired the further meaning of‘ cuni nota et igno·
minia aliquid sacere’‚ to perform any startling or violent act, any
act which upsets the existing order of things: ‘ and this'‚ he adds,
‘is exactly the sense required in the line of Horace, Of what
miracle is not intom'catz'on capable?' Cp. Plaut. Most. 413, Ter.
Adelph. 87, in both of which places (ίίπίξη. should probably be
read. opert-a‘ the secrets of the heart’. Sat. Ι. 4,89 „wax aperit
pyaecora'za Liber.- cp. Ep. Ι. 18, 38ς Α. Ρ. 434: Plat. Symp-
217 E εἰ μή πρῶτον μὲν τὸ λεγόμενον οἶνος ἄνευ τε παίδων καὶ μετα
παίδων ἦν ἀληθής. Compare the proverbs 111 11110 vezilas and
οἶνος καὶ παῖδες ἀληθεῖς.

inertem, ‘ coward⁷ (Cic. Cat. ΙΙ. 5, Ῑο) common in the
language of the camp as contrasted with strenuus miles .· cp, Ep.
Ι. 11, 28, and Tac. Hist. Ι. 46, iners pro strenuo: hence rnuch
better than inermem, the point being the inspiriting power of
wine, not the sollies which it can cause. Our ‘ Dutch courage ’.

17. spes: cp. Ar. Eth. Nic. 111. 8, 13 ἀλλ’ οἱ μὲν ἀνδρεῖοι διὰ
τὰ προειρημένα θαρραλέοι, οἱ δὲ διὰ τὸ οἴεσθαι κρείττους εἶναι καὶ
μηθὲν ἀντιπαθεῖν. τοιοῦτον δὲ ποιοῦσι καὶ οἱ μεθυσκόμενοι “ εὐέλπιδες

’γὰρ γίγνονται.

18. addocet, only here and in Cic. Cluent. 37, 104 addocti
iudices, the ad being intensive, or denoting increase and progress.

19. fecundi, ‘teeming‘ like our own ‘flowing bowl’: or
perhaps ‘pregnant', like our ‘pregnant wit⁷: there is no need
to soree the meaning of ‘inspiring' (but cp. Ov. Met. 1V. 697):
the reading facundi, which has a good deal of support, would
lead to an intolerable tautology with disertos.

20. contracta‘ cramped'.

21. imperor ‘1 charge rnyself’, apparently with the reflexive
force of the passive ε but cp. Munro on Lucret. 11. 156. Horace
