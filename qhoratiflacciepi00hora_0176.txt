29. volpecula: Bentley protests against this reading with
more than his usual energy. He calls upon sox-hunters‚ farmers
and rnen of science to bear witness that a fox could not eat corn
if he were never so hungiy: he has not the teeth to do it with.
Resides no sox however lean could creep through a crevice in a
corn-jar, unless it was large enough to let all the corn out.
Again how could a fox, a creature haunting the woods, have got
into a house at. all, or have been content to remain within doors
long enough to be positively fattened in the corn-jar? Besides
St Jerome expressly mentions a mouse in referring to the fable
by Aesop srom which this is borrowed. Hence he confidently
restores nitedula ‘a slnew-mouse' for the present volpecula.
Many recent editors, and both Conington and Martin in their
translations, have followed him3 but the soundest verdict has
been given by Munro (Introd. p. xxiv.)‚ ‘ Bentley's famous nile-
dula sor volpecula deserves all praise: it is brilliant3 is what
Horace ought to have written :—bnt I sadly sear did not write,
not from' lgnorance probably, but because hey had' 111 his thoughts
some old· world sable, whose foxes were not as our foxes'. We
might almost retoit upon Lachmann, who strongly supports
Bentley (on Lucret. ΙΙΙ. 1014), in his own words ‘vocabulum
Horatio restitutum qui [non] accipiunt rationem et genera sabel-
larum ignorant’. Keller aptly remarks that the list of animals
appearing in sables is a strictly limited one, that the sox osten
plays a part inconsistent with its natural habits, and finally that
a weasel would be more likely to eat a mouse than to give it

good advice! lt may be noticed that the weasel (γαλῆ) was
osten tamed and kep tyin Greek and Roman houses on purpose
to keep down the mice, the cat being comparatively rare, indeed
not commonly used as a domestic animal until the third or fourth
century A.D. Cp. Acaaz'my Vol. Χ., p. 317, Houghton's Natural
llz'stmy oftlze Anczents, pp. 40— 50.

30. cumeram3 cp. Sat. 1. 1. 53, where Acron notes ‘.c
dicimus vas ingens vimineum, in quo flumenta conduntur.. ,sive
cumerae dicuntur vasa fictilia similia doliis, ubi frumentum suum
reponebant agricolae’ . pasta, the participle of the reflexive
form pascor, used actively. S. G. ἓ 507.
