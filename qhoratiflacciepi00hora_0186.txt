Bentley does not attempt to defend the reading of the vet.
Bland. venturus, though supported by some of his own older
MSS„ as against the express testimony of Servius on Aen. 1V.
224, which is older than any of our MSS. It is evidently only
the correction of a grammarian who thought that Tibure must
mean ‘from Tibur'3 and is another indication that in some
places at all events the famous Blandinian MSS. give us a
elever recension, rather than a genuine tradition.

Tibur: Horace frequently represents himself as staying at
Tibur; and Suetonius (Vit. Horat.) says vixit plurimum in
secessu ruris sui Sabim· aut Tiburtini, domusque eius ostenditur
circa Tiburni luculum. I think it quite impossible with Orelli
to understand such passages as Carm. lv. 2, 30-32, 1V. 3, 10
as referring to Horace's Sabine sarm, which must have been at
least 12 miles from Tibur (cp. also Carm. 111. 4, 21—24):
Carm. 11. 18, 14 would at most prove that seven or eight years
before the date os this epistle he had only one estate in the
country, and (especially if we accept Madvig's interpretation of
satis as abl. of sata) would not tell at all against his ownership
of a domus elsewhere, which would not bring him any income.
Ritter’s notion that a house at Tibur was given to Horace by
Augustus as a reward sor the carmen saeculare in B.c. 17 is
ingenious, but has little support· I do not see why we should
reject the clear testimony of Suetonius: Horace does not de-
scribe his house at Rome any more than that at Tibur, but
