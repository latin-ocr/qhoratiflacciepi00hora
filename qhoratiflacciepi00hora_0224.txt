188 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

37. Bestius is introduced also by Persius VI. 37, but so as
to add nothing to what we can gather from this passage. He
was evidently an extravagant liver so long as his means held
out, and afterwards an unsparing critic of extravagance. The
character may very probably have been derived from Lucilius.
All the MSS. have either correctus or corrrptns: the latter
appears to give no good sense; but the former may, I think,
well be interpreted ‘like Bestius after his reformation '. Lambinus
asserted that he had found ‘in antiquissimo codice' corrector, and
this reading, though probably only a conjecture, has been adopted
by many subsequent editors. Bentley warmly defends it, quoting,
with his usual readiness, several passages in which corrector is
used for ‘critic’ or ‘censor ', and assuming that Bestius was a
proverbially severe censor. As the reading found in all known
MSS. yields a sufficiently good sense, Ι have followed Ritter
and Keller in retaining it.——Maenius is of course the subject of
diceret, and Bestius is in apposition, as in Vell. Pat. 11. 18
Mithridates.. ,odio in Romanos Hannibal.

39. verterat in fumum, a proverbial expression for ‘con-

sumed ‘ z we need not enquire what particular metaphor was in
the mind of Horace.

miror—si: Roby ἓ 1757, S. G. ἓ 747. Cp. θαυμάζω εἰ.

41. turdo: Sat. 11. ει, 74ς 5, 10. volva: the matrix of a
sow was and still is considered a great delicacy in Italy. It was
prepared with spices and vinegar, and eaten as a relish with
wine: Athen. ΙΙΙ. 59 ἐμπίνοντι δέ σοι φερέτω τοιόνδε τράγημα,
’γαστέρα καὶ μήτραν ἑφθὴν ὑός, ἕν τε κυμίνῳ ἕν τ’ ὀξεῖ δριμεῖ καὶ
σιλφίῳ ἐμβεβαῶσαν. It was more costly than any other kind of
meat commonly eaten, as Keller shows from Diocletian's edict
of A. D. 301 de preliis venalium (c. iv. 3 ed. Mommsen). Prof.
Palmer quotes very happily Alexis (Meineke Com. Graec.
p. 738 ed. min.) ὑπὲρ πάτρας μὲν πᾶς τις ἀποθνήσκειν θέλει, ὑπὲρ
δὲ μήτρας Καλλιμέδων ὁ Κάραβος ἑφθῆς ἴσως προσεῖτ’ ἄν ἄλλως
ἀποθανεῖν.

42. hic: cp. Ep. Ι. 6, 40. It is of course the pronoun,
although Macleane by comparing ἐνταῦθ’ εἰμί seems to take it as
the adverb. In Ter. Andr. 3¹0 tu sz' lzz'c sis aliler sentias, hic:
⁶550, not in lzoc loco: cp. Spengel’s note ad loc.

44. unctius ‘richer’ of food, asin Ep. 1. 17, 12 of persons.
Cp. Mart. V. 44, 7 unctior cena.

46. fundata. ‘based upon ’, not quite ‘invested in’: the
meaning seems to be that no man is in this case considered wise
and fortunate, unless all can see from his handsome marble
(nitidis) villas how firm is the basis on which his financial
prosperity rests. Cp. Cic. p. C. Rab. Post. 1. 1 fortunas fundatas
