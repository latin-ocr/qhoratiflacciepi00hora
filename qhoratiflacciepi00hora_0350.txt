314 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

124. ludentis, ‘of one in sport', not ‘of an actor': et
torquebitur, ‘and yet he will exert himself to the utmost’.
As the proverb has it, ‘easy writing makes hard reading’, so
a writer to seem at his ease, must put forth all his powers. One
of the most striking illustrations is Addison’s style, which
attained its consummate ease only after the most caresul revision.
Pope has again caught the point admirably3

But ease in writing flows from art, not chance,
As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance. -

The apparent ease of motion of the trained dancer is due only
to long continued effort.

125. satyrum...movetur: Roby ἕ 1120 (a), S. G. ἕ 469.
The Satyr would dance lightly, the Cyclops heavily and clumsily:
cp. Carm. Ι. 1, 31 nymplmrumque leves cum Satyris clzori:
Sat. 1. 5, 63 pastorem saltaret uli Cyclopa rogabat: Verg. Ecl.
V. 73 saltantis §illyres imitabitur.

126—140. A man wlm is labom‘iug under a delusz‘mz may
he a very happy man, and z't is not always kind lo dz'spel it.

126. praetulerim...ringi. Horace has been throughout this
Epistle attempting to prove to Florus why he must expect no
poems from him. Here he argues that as great exertions are
necessary to success, lejen ηε vaut par la cleamlelle. There are
some people who are blissfully unconscious of the worthlessness
of their own productioris, and live in a pleasing state of sels-
satisfaction. This he confessos, with some irony, to be the
happier state. But it is over for him now. He is like a man
who has been cured osan agreeable delusion, and restored to
the hard realities of lise. He knows he cannot write good poetry
without an effort, and it is not worth his while to make it. lt
is plain therefore that Horace is. speaking of himself, and not
of some one else, as Macleane says; and that there is no need of
a note of interrogation at ringi, as Kriiger and others print.
For the mood and tense cp. Roby ξ 1540, S. G. ξ 644 (b).

128. fingi, ‘to be worried': cp. Ter. Phorm. 341 dum
tibi fit qnod placeat, ille ringitur: rmgi (Macleane's ringere is
non-existent) is to show the teeth‚ used of an angry dog. Here
the meaning is to be vexed with a sense of sailure, not generally
(as Sehiitz) of the morose gloom (senium) of the philosopher.

haud ignobilis; quidam may be understood from the relative
in the next line. Pseiid.-Arist. Mir. Ausc. ἕ 30 tells the same
story of a man at Abydos: Aelian has a similar one of an
Athenian Thrasyllus, who sancied that all the ships sailing into
the Peiraeus belonged to him, until his brother got him cured.

Argis: the Romans changed '‘Ap-yos into Argi on thevanalogy
of names like Delphi, Va'z, Gabii, ete„ and perhaps misunder—
