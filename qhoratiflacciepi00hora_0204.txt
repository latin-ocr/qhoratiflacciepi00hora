168 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

21. seu piscis seu, etc. i.e. whatever the simple fare that
you are living on, sor simple I know it is. Fish is not, I think,
mentioned here as a deheacy, asin Sat. 11. 2, 1203 4, 37, Ep. 1.
15, 23: there is usually something in the context to point to that
suggestion, where it is sound3 and the thought sive laute sive
parre vivis (Comm. Cruq.) is out of place in connexion with the
philosophie Iccius. In trucidas there is a reference to the
Pythagoream doctrine of metempsychosis, accepted by Empe-
docles: cp. Hieronym. ad Iovin. 11. p. 331 probabo non
Empedoclis et thlmgorae 7205 dogma sectari, qui propter μετεμ-
ψύχωσιν omne qaod movetur et vivit edendmzc uon putant, et
eiusdem criminis reos arbitrantur, qm' abietem quercumque
succida-int, cuins parricidae sunt et venefici. ⁶ VVhatever the lives
which you are sacrificing sor your sood, whether those of fishes,
or only those of leeks and onions‚⁷ i.e. whether you follow
Empedocles in believing that even vegetables have souls, or do
not. Ritter objects that we do not hear elsewhere that the
Pythagoreans abstained from leeks and onions. Horace does
not imply that they did, but only that in eating them they thought
they were destroying living beings. They would have had little
enough to live on, if they had abstained srom everything which
involved the death of either animal or vegetable. His own
notion that Horace is asking Iccius to employ Grosphus in
catching fish and gathering onions as part of thesrnctus Agrippae
is not likely to find many supporters.

22. utere ‘make a friend of’. Ep. Ι. 17, 2.

ultro involves a slight oxymoron after ‘si quid petet', sor it
properly means ‘unasked'. Here we may translate ‘readily'.

23. verum ‘right’, Ep. 1. 7, 98. Cp. Milton Par. L. IV.
750.

24. vilis est annona ‘the price is low’ ε Horace derives this
expression from Xen. Mem. 11. 10, 4 νῦν δὲ διά τὰ πράγματα
εὐωνοτάτους ἔστι φίλους ἀγαθοὺς κτήσασθαι, but whereas Socrates
there means to say ‘the times are so bad, that a small service is
enough to secure a man’s sriendship', Horace’s thought seems
to be rather that when a good man is in want, his demands are
not likely to be exorbitant, and hence it will not eost much to
secure his friendship.

25—29. J can send you news from Rome of victorias z'n tlte
lVest and Easl, and of aaz excellent harvest.

25. ne ignores...loco res: for the accidental Leonine verse,
produced by the assonance of these two phrases, cp. Ep. 1. 14, 73
Wagner on Verg. Georg. Ι. 157; Aen. IX. 634 transgrit. l, verbis
viantem illude superbis, where the rhythm is perhaps intentional.
Ov. Met. XII Ι. 378 Si Troiae fillis aliquid restare putatis is
