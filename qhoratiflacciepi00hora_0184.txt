148 HORA TI EPISTULAE.

88. media de nocte: Roby ἓ 1911, S. G. ἓ 812 (ιίὶε 112 will
not wait sor the daylight before he carries out his impatient
resolve. caballum, usually of a riding horse, as in Sat. Ι. 6, 59,
Ep. 1. 14, 43, Juv. X. 60 (cp. 111. 118), but here probably of a

cart—horse, as in Ep. Ι. 18, 36. Mena is not likely to have kept a
‘cob’, as some render it.

91. durus=duripatiens laboris : cp. Ep. 1. 16, 70. attentus

nd 12111 (Ter. Ad. 834): cp. Sat. 11. 6, 82 asper et attentus
quaesztzs.

92. pol: Ep. 11. 2, 138. This expression was used both
by men and women (Gell. XI. 6, Macrob. Ι. 12, 28) though the
latter preferred as a rule mecastor, probably because of the
resemblance in sound to castum and castitas (Preller, R'om.

Myth. p. 653). Terence never uses this form, but in Plautus
11 is common.

93. ponerezimponere: cp. Sat. Ι. 3, 42 isti errori nomen
vz’rlus posuisset honestum .· so τιθέναι ὄνομα. The inferior MSS.
give dicere, which is an explanatory gloss. Cp. Plaut. Pers.

lv. 4, 2 5 nunc et illum miserum et me miseram aequom est
nommarzer.

94. quod, Roby ἓ 2214, S. G. ξ 871, 5. Cp. Verg. Aen.
Π. 141 quod te per superos...0ro with Conington’s note: ib.
Vl. 363. Ter. Andr. 289 quod ego per lzanc te dextram oro
ct genium lnam (XVagner). For the genius or tutelary spirit
cp. Ep. ΙΙ. 2, 187, and see Preller, Rom. Myth. p. 567: ‘the
genius as such is always good, and the source of the good
gifts and hours which brighten the life of the individual man,
and also the source of his physical and mental health, in a
word, his good spirit: hence the oaths and conjurings by one’s
own genius or that of another, in which latter case along with
the genius of a friend, his right hand, i.e. his honour, his eyes,
i.e. the light of his body, or his Penates, i.e. the sanctities of
his house and home, are often named ’.

96. qui semel aspexit. Horace, aster his fashion, sums
up the lesson of the foregoing story in brief. The reading semel
appears to be found only in the cod. lllart. of Cruquius: all
other MSS. have the meaningless simul, which has come in
from v. 90. It is possible that aspexit is due to a like blundel·
on the part of a copyist: in any case it is an awkward repetition,
especially as the word is used in a sornewhat different sense.
But cp. circumdala in Sat. 1. 2, 96, 99, accedere, Sat. 11. 3,
149, 154. Keller conjectured, but has now wstbdrawn, agnovit.
Cp. Ep. 1. 17, 4.

98. verum, ‘right ’, Sat. 11. 3, 212, Ep. Ι. 12, 23. So often
