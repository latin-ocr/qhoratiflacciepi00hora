take it as seriously meant, and as referring to Pollio, Vergil,
Varius and others of the circle round Maecenas : ultor is then an
expression of kindly humour, and not of bitterness, as in Juv. 1. 1
‘I who listen only to writers of name and sanie, and retaliate
upon them, do not deign to court etc) Bentl. argues that
Horace did not recite his own poenis: but the very passage to
which he refers, shows the conditions on which he did: Sat. Ι. 4,
73 nec recito cuiquam nisi amicis, idque coactus, non ubivis
coramve quibuslibet. The ‘Globe’ version: ‘I will not lower
myself by listening to and desending grand writers, so as to
curry favour ' etc. is impossible.

40. grammaticas: Porph. takes tribus to refer to the
crowds of scholars‚ pulpita ‘ chairs ³ to the teachers. But as the
metaphor is evidently that of a candidate courting the suffrages
of the Roman tribes at an election, and as the grammar-iane
themselves, rather than their pupils, would be the voters, it is
better to take grammaticas:grammaticorum, and pulpita as a
touch to add graphio force, rather than as introducing a distinct
class. tribus has probably a touch of contempt in it, like our
own ‘tribe’ and φῦλον. The pulpitum was properly the plat-
sorm of the stage (Ep. 11. 1, 174, A. P. 215, 274), but here it is
transferred to the (lais on which the teaeher's chair (cathedra Sat.
l. 10, 91) would be placed.

41. hinc fflae lacrimae. In the Andria of Terence old
Simo tells how his son Pamphilus shed tears at the funeral of
a neighbour of theirs named Chrysis. At first the father took
it to be a sign of his son's affectionate character, that he was
so much touched hythe death of a mere acquaintance. But it
turned out that Chrysis had left a eharining sister: and 'when
the old man saw her (V. 12¹5) percussit ilico animum. Atat,
hoc illud est, lzinc illae lacrimae, llaec illast misericordia. The
phrase became proverbial, and was used as here even when there
was no question of actual tears. Cp. Cic. pro Cael. 25, 61 sin
autem iam iam suberat simultas, exstincta crat consuetudo, disci-
dium exstiterat, lzz'nc illac lacrimae nimirum ct haec causa est om-
nium horum scelerum atque criminum.
