310 HORAT] EPISTULAE.

107. scribentes ‘while they are writing'‚ i.e. in the mere
act of doing so. Cp. Catull. xxii. 15 neque idem unquam acque
est heatus ac poema cum scribit.

108. si taceas, laudant, i. e. it is their habit ‘to praise their
compositions‚ and they would do so, even if you should say
nothing about them. Cp. Mayor on Juv. Χ. 141, Roby ἓ 1574,
S. G. ἓ 654. beati goes with laudant rather than with scripsere, or
else there would be a tautology after gaudent scribentes.

109. legitimum ‘according to the rules of art’3 A. P. 274.
fecisse, not ἀορίστως as Orelli says, but used because the result
rather than the process is the object os desire. Soin Ep. Ι. 17, 5.
Cp. Roby§ 1374, S. G. ἓ 541 (b).

110. cum tabulis ‘along with his tablets’‚ i. e. when he
begins to write. XVax tablets were used sor the first rough draft,
which might need correction (cp. Sat. Ι. 10, 72 saepe stilum ver-
lczs); then the sair copy was made upon paper. These tablets
sor notes were osten called pugillares (Plin. Ep. 1. 6, 13 111. 5, 15)
or simply cerae. 1 doubt much whether there is any διλογία, as
Orelli supposes, playing upon the tabulae censoriae. But in the
following lines words are used, which certainly point to the cen-
sor’s functions: splendor is a word especially applied to the ordo
equester (eg. Cic. de F in. 11. 18, 58 eques Romanus splendidus,
pro Sext. Rosc. 48, 140 equestrem splendorem) ; and loco movere
reealls lrilm movere.

l ⁸ honesti ‘ conscientious', one who will act loyally as duty bids
nm.

111. audebit. ‘lie will resolve’ v. 148. Ep. 1. 2, 40. quae-
cumque sc. verba.

112. ferentur ‘will be current ’ when published. So Keller
and Seh'utz, quoting Lucil. xxx. 4M. (,:906 L.) et· sola ex
multis mcnc nostra poemata ferri. Others ‘will be judged',
comparing Verg. Aen. VI. 823 uscunque fierent ea facta minores.
Orelli, less probably, takes the metaphor as that of a river ⁴ quae
rapido cursu fertur‘, cp. Sat. 1. 4, 1 1 flueret lutulentus.

The future ferentur though it lias but slight MS. authority is
clearly necessary: Ritter almost alone retains the reading of
the best lussjeruntur.

113. invita keeps up the personification of the verba which
has been suggested by the metaphor of the censor, and perhaps
too by honore indigna.

114. versentur intra penetralia Vestae: Sch'utz (aster
Porph.: ‘ id est, domi’) takes this to mean simply the privacy of
the poet's own house, srom which the poems are not yet sent
