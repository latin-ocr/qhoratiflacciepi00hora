162 HORA TI EPISTULAE.

6. Lebedum, a small town on the sea between Smyrna and
Colophon. odio maris, cp. Carm. ΙΙ. 6, 7 lasso maris et viarum,·
Tac. Ann. 11. 14 ίαςίίὶο viarum ac maris ; Cic. ad Fam. XVI. 4, 1
non dubito quin, quoad plane valeas, te neque navzgralz'ouz' neque
viae comm illas.

7—10. These lines are marked in the codd. Bland. as a dia-
logue between Bullatius and Horace, thus: BULL. Scis...sz·t?
HOR. Galzz'is...v2'cns. BULL. tamen...fic1‘enlem. We need not
assign Gabl'l's...vz'cus to Horace : but it is very probable that the
whole passage is to be regarded as spoken by Bullatius. There
is a close parallel in Ep. 1. 16, ,φῖ-43, where the answer osa
supposed interlocutoi· is similarly brought in without any intro-
ductory word, and Horace demurs with a sentence beginning
with sed. We get additional point in line 26, if we suppose the
reference there to be to Lebedus. This view has the support of
Haupt and other good recent editors. Sir T. Martin supposes
that Bullatius had expressed himself to this effect in some letter
to Horace: this is hardly necessary. The idea may have been
drawn from his character. Lebedus is a desolate plase, but I should
be glad la live there in retirement, walchiug tlte raging· sea.

7. Gabus: cp. Juv. V1 56, x. 100, where Gabii and Fidenae
are coupled as uni1np01tant places. Of Gabii, Dionys. Hal.
Ant. R. IV. 53 says νυν μὲν οὐκέτι συνοικουμένη πᾶσα, πλὴν ὅσα
μέρη πανδοκεύεται κατὰ. τήν ὀδόν [i. e. the road to Praeneste]
τότε δὲ πολυάνθρωπος καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλη μεγάλη.

8. fidenis: Verg. Aen. VI. 773 shortens the first syllable,
urbemque Fidenam, Juvenal l. c. like Prop. IV. (V) 1, 36 length-
ens it.

vellem. Roby§ 1536, S. G. §644-

9. oblitus, ‘my friends forgetting, by my friends sorgot‚'
Con. and Martin3 a version imitated from Pope's imitation of
Horace, Eloisa to Abelard, ¹207:

‘How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot,
The world forgefflng, by the world forgot.’

11. lutoque. Some commentators have gravely doubted
whether there was mud in the Appian VVay. Lucilius (Frag.
88 Lachm.) seems to have found some ι omne iter est lzoc labarum
alque lutosum. The road was at this time strewn with grave]
(glarca) instead of silex. XVilmanns, no. 935.

11— 16. Nay, bnt what may be good enoug crlz fhra time, will
not salz'ssy one always.

12. caupona. The metaphor of an inn was commonly
employed by the philosophers of the time, e. g. Arrian Epict.
