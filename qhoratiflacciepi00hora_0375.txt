NOTES. 339

τένοντας Graeci appellant, but sometimes appears to include
also what we call ‘nerves’z see Mayor’s note on Cic. Nat.
Deor. ΙΙ. 55, 136. Galen (born Α.Ι). 130) was the first to limit
νεῦρον to the meaning ‘ nerve ’, in its present sense.

27. animi ‘spirit'. professus grandia: cp. Quint. x. 2, 16
plerumque (imitatores) declinant in peius et proxima virtutibus
vitia comprehendunt fiantque pro grandibus tumidi.

28. serpit humi. Horace mixes the metaphors of one who
sears to soar and so creeps along the ground, and of a sailor
who hugs the shore in his dread of a storm. Cp. Carm. ΙΙ. ιο,
1 ff. Perhaps there is a reference to pedestris oratio.

29. prodigialiter occurs in good Latin only hcre and in

Colum. 111. 3, 3. In Plaut. Amph. 732 prodigazzlis luppiter is
the god who sends marvels. Hence the word seems to mean

‘so as to produce a marvellous effect’. Kriiger and Keller (in

his smaller edition) adopt Jeep’ 5 punctuation and interpretation
qui αα) zare cupi& rem prgodz ‹ialztcw unam, ‘he who desires to
give variety paints—a. marvel of unit> —-a dolphin' 1n the woods’
etc.‚ referring to Madvig on Cic. de Fin. ΙΙ. 23 75 rtem ια’ ’'rlzc t
dzſjfczlcm et obscumm. 2>But it is doubtful whether vamme can
thus be separated from 7cm; and theie seems no reason to depart
from the natural rendering. ‘he who wishes to lend variety to
one and the same subject2> so as to introduce a marv'.el This
Keller now admits. Perhaps it is better to take unam as
merely denot‘mg ‘one and the same ', rather than as ‘simple '.

30. delphinum: the Greek δελφίν or δελφίς becomes
usually delphinus in Latin, as ἐλέφας becomes elephantum but
Ovid has twice delphin as the nom. (found occasionally in other
poets), and five times αἶ’ἰρίιὶηα as the acc. sing.. · Vergil (once—
Aen. VIII. 673 )and Ovid (three times) have delphmes as nom.
sing ‚and Vergil (Ecl. V111. 56) has delphinas as acc. plur. Ovid
hasg the abl. delplzz'nein Met. ΧΙ. 237, and the gen. plur. delphz-
num is found thrice' in Vergil and once in Propertius But these
Greek forms are entirely confined to poetry: cp. Cic. de Nat. D.
1. 27, 77, Neue, Formenlehre Ι.2 322.

32. Aemilium ludum, according to Porph. a gladiator-iai
school near the Forum, built by an Aemilius Lepidus, who can-
not now be identified with any one of the many who bore that

name at or about this time.

imus was confessedly the reading of the archetype, but
Bentley' s conjecture unus has found almost universal acceptation;
not only those editors who usually follow him, but even those who
set least value on his judgment admit it. Macleane says ‘there
can be no doubt that it is the true reading’, and Keller ‘after
weighing the whole question a hundred times, unus appears to
