221. mox etiam: Orelli (after Hand Turs. 111. 656) renders
‘forthwith too’, in order to avoid the apparent discrepancy with
Aristotle Poet. 1v. 17 διὰ τὸ ἐκ σατυρικοῦ μεταβαλεῖν, which
represent satyric drama as older than tragedy. 1f there is a
contradiction, this is but a lame way of removing it. But the
fact seems to be that while tragedy originated in the song of a
band of satyrs,-—as Aristotle implies——and hence sor a time
tragedy and the satyrical drama were identical, as it developed,
it came to be far removed from thern, and the chorus was dif-
ferently constituted3 until Pratinas of Phlius, a contemporary
of Aeschylus, restored the chorus of satyra, and wrote plays for
them, which were the beginning ofa new satyric drama (Donald-
son l. c. p. 69, Bergk ΙΙΙ. 261).

The length at which Horace discusses the satyric drama,
which is commonly supposed to have been quite unknown to
Roman literature, and took but a subordinate place even in
Greek, seems to require some explanation. It has been sug-
gested that one of the Pisos, or perhaps even Horace himself
had had thoughts of naturalizing it at Rome, where the comic
drama at this time stood in much need of something to revive it.
But Prof. Nettleship has given some reasons from Diomedes
(p. 490 K.) to think that the Romans had a satyric drama.
Vv. 220—224 he regards as a translation from the Greek critic,
whom Horace is using throughout, vv. 225—250 as his own ex-
pansion and correction.

i.e. tells how P. solaced herself, and often. But here we have a
bold extension of this usage. Peerlkamp objects that the satyrs
were always nudi, i.e. clad only lightly in skins, and that nuda-
vit is therefore out of place: but Horace is doubtless thinking
rather of the chorus, who were made to throw off their usual dress,
and appear as satyrs. Cp. Munro's critical note on Lucr. v. 971
where nuda dabant is now read sor the nudabant of the MSS.
