180 HORATI EPISTULAE.

liquidum potet Alauda merum, turbida sollicito transmittere Cae-
cuba sacco. This process was necessary for the stronger wines,
so that the epithet is not out of place here, as Ritter thinks.

36. incidere ‘to cut short‘. Verg. Ecl. 9, 14 novas inci-

darei1 ltres3d There is a kind of zeugma, puderet being understood
wlt zncz ere.

‘No shame I deem it to have had my sport:
The shame had been in frolics not cut short ’. CON.

38. limat from lima ‘a file’‚ hence ‘to diminish’ or ‘dis-
parage’. But Lachmann on Lucret. 111. 11 (p. 143) justly
pointed out that Horace here intends a play upon the phrase

lmzz's oculis=0bliquo oculo ‘ askance’, and compares the Plautine
dolum dolare (Mil. 938).

morsuque: cp. Carm. lv· 3, 16 iam dente minus mordeor
invido.
venenat. ‘nove‚ id est fascz'nat’ Comm. Cruq. Horace seems

to have been the first to use the word in a metaphorical sense.
It occurs with its literal force in Lucret. VI. 820.

39. rident: doubtless good-humouredly‚ but Horace’s figure
and habits must have unfitted him for active exercise. Hence
Dill. is hardly right in his note ‘ non ob imperitiam poetae, sed
quod elegantiorem hominem his laboribus exerceri vident et
mirantur'.

glaeba and gleba seem equally well authenticated forms, but
the former is the earlier; so too caepe and cepe. Cp. Ribbeck
Prol. Verg. p. 414, Brambach fliigfsb. s.v.

Madvig (Advers. Crit. ΙΙ. 61) argues that the stop should
follow servis not moventem. The emphasis, he says, lies upon
urbana, which must therefore be brought into prominence, and
cum servis is out of place in the second sentence, for the vilicus
would be in the company of slaves quite as much in the country
as in the town. But a vilicus would not be allowanced in the
country. Resides, as Keller justly points out, horum then be—
comes unintelligible. The juxtaposition of servis and urbana,
though not quite a hypallage, naturally suggests to the mind the
notion of town-slaves, which horum takes up.

t or.
fi ἑο. diaria: one or two MSS. have cibaria as a gloss, and
this has displaced the true reading in some other MSS. Keller

thinks it was an innovation of Mavortius. rodere, ‘munch’‚
suggests poor and limited fare.
