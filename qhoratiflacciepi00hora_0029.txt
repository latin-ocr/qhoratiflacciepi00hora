JNTRODUCTJON. xxv

that little weight is to be given to the readings of
this class, where they differ from those of both the
others.
To this class Keller and Holder assign
B Bernensis 363, probably the oldest of all
extant MSS. of Horace, written by an Irish
monk in the eighth or ninth century, as
is proved by some Irish glosses in the
margin. Unfortunately it ends at Sat. i.
134, thus including the Ars Poelz'ca (ex-
cept vv. 440—476), but omitting all the
Epistles.
V the vetus codex Blandinius (see below).
the codex Gothanus, apparently derived from
V, and giving all the Epistles, but not the
Ars Poelz'ca (saec, xv).
C Monacensis 14685, closely agreeing with B,
and hence only available for the Ars

(r
δ

poetica.

Class ΙΙΙ. derived from a very carelessly written
original, and marked by all kinds of errors, but with
traces of a good tradition, and as a rule very good
in orthography.

To this class belong

φ Parisinus 7974 (saec. x).

ψ Parisinus 7971 (saec. x). The assumed com-
mon source of these two is denoted F.

l Leidensis Sat. 28 (saec, x).
