Bk. 11. Ep. 11.] NOTES. 305

In this reading the tlirice repeated alter is sar from elegant,
and the combination uterque alterins very dubious Latin. Keller
removes the latter difficulty, but increases the former by substi-
tuting et alter sor uterque. But, as Bentley saw, there is no point
in making the two men brothers (as there is in v. 183), and the
corruption is likely to be in the word frater. Schiitz suggests
fautor, which goes far to remove the difficulty. It is a favourite
word with Horace in very similar expressions: cp. Sat. 1. 10, 2
tam Lucili fautor: Ep. 11. 1, 2 3 sic fautor veterum : Ep. Ι. 15, 3 3
nequitiae fautoribus.- Ep. Ι. 18, 66 fautor laudabit: and the
meaning of the substantive allows it to take or to dispense with
an adverb, as much as an adjective could. That there was
mutual patronage may well be lest to be understood from the
context. [Prof. Palmer suggests auctor erat consulto, a reading
which restores a good Classical phrase ι ‘a rhetorician proposed
to a lawyer '.]

89. GracchuS, undoubtedly Gahm, who is praised by Cicero
Brut. 33, 126 as a greater orator than his elder brother Tiberius:
eloquentia quidem nescia an habuisset parem neminem. Bentley
suggested as a correction Crassus, i.e. L. Licinius Crassus, the
famous orator, who takes a leading part in Cicero’s three books
De Oratore. Cicero (Brut. 39, 145) describes how a case was
argued on the one side by Crassus, and on the other by his friend
and colleague in ,the consulship L. Mucius Scaevola the Pontifex
ul eloquentium iuris peritissimus Crassus, z'm-z's peritorum clo-
qucntissz'mus Scaevola putaretur (cp. De Orat. 1. 39, 180 note).
Hence the line of Horace would gain in point by the substitution of
Crassus for Gracchus: but this is not a sufficient reason to induce
us to abandon the MSS. If Horace had any particular Mucius
in view, it was probably the colleague of Crassus: but several
other members of the family were distinguished for their legal
learning, especially P. Mucius Scaevola Pont. Max. (the father
of the colleague of Crassus, consul himself in P..C. 133) and Q.
Mucius Scaevola Augur (the father-in-law of Crassus, consul
I³.C. 117). Hence perhaps we should translate ‘so that the one
was a Gracchus, the other a Mucius’.

foret huic ut Mucius flle ε all known MSS. have hic ut lllucius
illi, but as early as 1516 this was corrected into the now all but
universally received lztu'c ille. It is plainly impossible to believe
that Horace should have written ut lzz'c illi Gracchus soret, lzt'c
illi Mucius. Keller adduces examples of hic-hic, but none where
ille is also used in the passage. This line must therefore be re-
