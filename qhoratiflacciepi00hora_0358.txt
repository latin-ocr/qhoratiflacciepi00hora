322 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

357 testor utrumque caput, and other instances quoted by Munro

on Lucret. 11. 433. See Reid on Cic. Acad. 1. 2, 5 utramque
vcm.

175. sic quia: Keller holds that the archetype here had
si, but admits that sz'c is a necessary correction.

176. alterius is somewhat redundant, being really implied
in heredem: but Bentley does not much improve matters with
- his alternis: for the passage which he quotes from Lactantius
does not suffice to show that alternis can be used of regular
progression, not of change backwards and forwards. Por-
phyrion⁷s explanation ‘ ut fluctus super se invicem veniunt' does
not necessarily imply that he read alternis.

1⁷⁷. vici. rustici; Acron explains villae, but the word
conveys more than that: rather ‘estates', or as Mr Yonge
suggests ‘manors’. Cp. Cic. ad Att. Ι. 4 Crassum divitiis
supero, atque omnium vicos et prata contemno (where Boot is
clearly wrong in taking vicos to be landed property in the city) z
ad Fam. XIV. 1, 5 scribis te vicum vendituram. In Ep. 1.
11, 8: 15, 7 (grouped with this passage and that last quoted
in the dictionaries based on Freund) the meaning is quite
different.

calabfiS...1.ucani: flocks of sheep were pastured in the
plains of Calabria or Apulia during the winter, and driven up
into the hills of Lucania or Samnium for the summer. Cp.
Epod. Ι. 27, pecusve Calabris ante sidus fervidum Lucana
mutet pascuis: Varro R. R. 11. 1, 16 itaque greges ovium longe
abiguntur ex Apulia in Samnium aestivatnm: ΙΙ. 2, 9 mz'lzz'
greges in A palia hibernabant, qai in Reatinis montibus aestiva-
bant. Cp. Carm. Ι. 31, 5 non aestuosae grata Calabriae armenta.
A similar practice is still observed in Spain for the Merino
sheep.

178. metit: Orcus is the true reaper after all; ‘est trans-
latio a segete ac messoribus’, Porph.

180—189. Some men valae hagrlzZy wlzat others care nothing
for. Even brotlzers have strangely dzfferent tastes, and tlte reason
for this z's mysterious.

180. Tyrrhena sigma, little bronze statuettes of deities, of
which numbers are still preserved in museums. Porphyrion
says apud Tuscos primos ltaliae segma de marmore processerunt:
but marble has been already mentioned3 besides, these would
not be called szgz'lla. Cp. Dennis Cz'tz'es and Cemeterz'es of
Etruria 12 lxxiv„ and 11. p. 233 sor a figure of one of the
most archaic. Cic. de Nat. D. Ι. 85 novi Epicureos omnia sigilla
venerantes. These were osten carried about attached to the
person, like Louis XI's little leaden images of the saints.
