414 Ales POETJCA.

rantibus [a cognatis?] illorum fuisse credantur, qui efferuntur.
Hi ergo vocantur θρηνῳδοί.’ 1f Alexandriae is not corrupt, this
looks as if he knew nothing of the custom at Rome. Keller
says that there were ‘Spitalerinnen' in Ulm till sar into the
present century who ‘howled' sor pay at sunerals.

433. derisor: Ep. Ι. 18, 11. plus, more usual than magis
with verbs of emotion.

434. reges ‘princes'‚ i. e. wealthy men, as in Sat. 1. 2, 86
regibus laic mos est, Sat. 11. 2, 45 epulis regum. Still it may have
its usual force here.

culillis: Keller on Carm. Ι. 31, 11—the only other place
where this word is found—shows that the evidence is strongly in
favour of this form as against cztlnllz's: the derivationis uncer-
tain, but the word is probably akin to ῑιιῖιζψιαΞΚυλίχνη (Fest.
p. 51), and it certainly has nothing to do with culleus, as Acron
says.

435. torquere: Ep. 1. 13, 38. The story of Tiberius, quoted
by Orelli, is of very doubtful applicability. perspexisse: v. 98.

laborent seems to be on the whole better supported than
laborant,¹ Bentley says ‘ sane quid modus subiunctivus hic faciat,
non video’, and most recent editors (even Keller) follow him.
But surely the relative clause is suboblique. If the construction
had been ‘dicunt reges etc. ³, the subjunctive would have been
almost necessary; as it is, it is at least legitimate.

436. an ‘to see whether': in such cases an affirmative
answer is suggested: cp. Zumpt § 354, v. 462. condes : Ep. Ι.
32 ²4·

437. sub volpe. In Aesop's sable of the sox and the crow,
the fox plays the part of a crafty flatterer bent upon securing
something for himself, and so here is used for the adsentator ot*
v. 4²0 ff. It is quite needless to say, with many editors, that
‘ fox‘ is here used sor ‘fox’s skin⁷‚ or to try to bring in the skin
by bold emendations z e. g. Peerlkamp suggestsfczllent sub amica
pelle latentes, Ribbeck volpes sub pelle latentes, as if there were
several foxes in one skin l Pers. V. 1 16 forces the note as usual,
fi'onle politus astutam vapido sewwzs in pectore volpem.

438. Quintilio: Quintilius Varus of Cremona, whose death
in B.C. ²4 Horace laments in Carm. 1. 24, where he ascribes to
him incorrupta fides nudaque veritas: he is probably the Varus
of Epod. V. and Carm. 1. 18, and was also a friend of Vergil,
who insigni concordia et familiarilate usus est Quintili Tuccae
et Vari, buthe must not be confused with Varius or with Vergil’s
Alfenus Vams: aiebat· shows that he was dead at this time.
sodes: Ep. 1. 1, 62 (note). κοῖται-ες, frequentative: Roby§ 1716,
S. G. ἓ 7²0 (though he omits sz': but cp. Kiihner 11. ἓ 214, 5:
