234 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

a positively good one is in A. P. 469 ‘much talked of’. Even
in Tacitus it has hardly acquired the meaning of ‘renowned ' ε
cp. Hist. 111. 38, and Heraeus on Hist. Ι. 10.

32. hunc, unquestionably Alcaeus. Archilochus was not
included among the lyric poets, strictly speaking. Catullus and
perhaps Calvus had already used the Sapphic metre3 but no
one as yet the mette os Alcaeus. Cp. Carm. 111. 30, 13 dicar...
princeps Aeolium carmen ad Italos deduxisse modos: Carm. I.

32, 53 IV. 9, 3·

34. ingenuis ‘gentle ’‚ not, as Porph. says, claiming a moral
superiority over his predecessors, Archilochus and Lucilius (who
is altogether out of the question), who had indulged in great
license of language3 but contrasted with the ventosa plebs of

‘'‚gentlemen sich as those named in Sat. I. 10, 81—90. Con-

Well may the bard feel proud, whose pen supplies

Latini: Quintil. XII. 10, 14 praecz’pzze presserunt eum (Μ. Tul-
lium), qui videri Atticorum imitatores cupiebant. Tacitus often
uses the word in this sense.

37. ventosae: Ep. I. 8, 12.

plebis does not seem to be limited, as Orelli says, 1ο the
foetae et grammatici infimi ordinis: it naturally refers to all
who could be gathered to listen to a recitation. For recitations
at Rome cp. the exhaustive note of Prof. Mayor on Juv. 111. 9.

38. impensis cenarum: the numerous instances of feasts
given to the people by those who would gain their favour are
collected by Madvig meassng etc. 11. 363.

tritae: cp. Pers. Ι. 54 scis comitem horridulum trita donare
lacerna .· Mart. XII. 72, 4 trz'laepraemia certa togae.

39. nobilium: is this ironical or not? If it is, we must
take it thus: ‘ Ι never listen to these illustrious writers, and re-
