394 Ales POETJCA.

verno [empore purgationem sumunt, quod vacatur καθαρτικόν, a
custoin by no means unknown to anxious mothers nowadays.

303. faceret, sc. if I did not take a purgative in spring.

304. nil tanti est: either (1) ‘it is not at all worth while'.
where ηῐίεούὄέν, a strong negative, or (2) ‘nothing is worth
such a eost ', i.e. even the reputation of a poet is not worth the
loss of one's reason. The force of the phrase in Cic. ad Att. 11.
13, 2 and v. 8, 3 supports the previous view. Cp. Madv.
Gramm. ἓ 294 obs. 3, opusc. Π. 188 sf. Roby§ 1193, S. G.§494.

cotis: so Isocrates, when asked why he taught others to
speak but never spoke himself, replied καὶ αἱ ἀκόναι αὐταὶ μὲν
τεμεῖν οὐ δύνανται, τὸν δὲ σίδηρον ὀξέα καὶ τμητικὸν ποιοῦσιν

(Ps.-P1ut. Vzt. X. Orat. 4).

306. munus et officium, sc. scribendi, to be understood
from :nil scribens: of the two words officium is the stronger, as
carrying with it the idea of moral obligation.

307. opes, ‘stores' of material: formet ‘moulds': v. 108,
126, Ep. ΙΙ. 1, 128. 'she derivation of the wordforma from the
root dhar ‘to hold in', whence also frenum etc. (Curt. Prine.
1. 319) shows that ‘mould' is the primary meaning of the word:
if we take it to be from fir ‘strike’ (with fiel< KZ. XX. 173),
it exactlyzrt'mros. Hence there is no ὕστερον πρότερον as Peerl-
kamp supposes,

308. vinna i.e. a true knowledge of the canons of the
poetic art: ἀρετή.

309. Here begins the third main division of the poem, and
the rest of it is but an expansion of the ideas of vv. 307—8.

309—322 (unde parentur opes). T he first requisita fhr ’ῑυνῐίὴῃγ

recte sapere, ‘a sound jndgment and correct knowledge’
of the matter to be dealt with, as it is clear from the context.
Orelli goes too sar in giving the word a general meaning: ‘recte
cogitare atque iudicare de omnibus rebus’.

310. rem, i.e. especially the facts of human nature and cha-
racter. Socraticae: besides Plato and Xenophon, Horace pro-
bably was thinking also of the writings of Aeschines (ep. Zeller,
Socrates, p. 208, E. T.>‚ and perhaps Antisthenes: whether he
included the later Academics and 510105, as Schutz thinks, is
very doubtful. For other pupils of Socrates who wrote ep. Reid
on CiefAcad. 11. 23, 74.
