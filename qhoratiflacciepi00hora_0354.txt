159. consultis as in v. 87. mancipat ‘makes your property’.
Strictly speaking manczpare could be used only of the transfer-
ence of chattels by the formal manczpalio just described. But
uninterrupted enjoyment (usus, usucapio) of moveable property
sor one year, of immoveable for two years gave a legal title, in
the case of res manczpc' and res nec manczspz‘ alike; and this is
here loosely described by the term mancipare. The word is used
by Tacitus (Hist. ΙΙ. 71) for ‘give up to'——lnxu et saginae manci-
patus emptasque [not in Cic. de Sen. 11, 38: cp. Reid's note]‚
but nowhere else quite as here. The line of thought is ‘If not
merely purchase, but also continuous enjoyrnent makes property
your own, then there is no advantage in the ownership osa large
estate: you enjoy it just as much if you can purchase enough of
its produce to supply your needs’. Cp. Cic. ad Fam. V11. 30 id
cuiusque est proprium, quo quisque fruitur atque ulilm‘.

160. Orbius is quite unknown.

161. daturas has been preferred by most editors since
Bentley to the alternative reading da'tzcrzts. Keller has returned
to the latter on the strength of what he considers the better MSS.
But the codd. Bland. and other good MSS. have datm-as, and the
word seems to go better with the ‘corn-fields’ (segetes) than with
the bailiff: cp. Verg. Georg. 11. 440, 520.

163. temeti, an old word used by Plautus, and by Cato ac-
cording to Plin. XIV. 13, 90 Calo ideo propz'nquosfi’minzk osculum
dare [scripsit], ut scirent an temetum olerent. Hoc lum vino nomen
erat, unde el temulentia appellata. A hstemz‘us is also akin: cp.
Gell. X. 23, 1 (zelarem abstemias egisse, lwc est vino semper, quod
temetum prisca lingua appellabatur, abstinuisse ; and as the root
seems to denote confusion and darkness, we may connect temere
and tenebrae. The passage in Cic. (de Rep. IV. 6) cited by
Nonius is virtually a quotation from the old law. Cp. Juv.
xv. 2 5.

modo isto: Lachmann (on Luat-et. p. 197) wished to read
modo sto in order to avoid the elision osan iambus in an acute
syllable, quite correcssy, so far as the pronunciation goes3 but
there is not a trace in the MSS. here of this spelling.

164. mercaris. The purchaser of the estate has to pay the
price down, while a man who buys the produce secures all the
advantage of it, and has only to pay by instalments. But, as
Schiitz notices‚ Horace seems to sorget that after the full value
of the land had been pald in these instalments, the purchaser of
