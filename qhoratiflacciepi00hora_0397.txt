ginals. Ennius e.g. translates almost literally Eur. Med. 502 ff.
in his Medea, frag. x. Ribbeck.

134. desilies ln artum ‘plunge into a place where you will
be cramped'. A writer who begins by copying too closely a
Greek original either in treatment, or in diction, will soon find
that heis as it were working in setters. Mr Yonge reminds us
of Aesop's fable of the goat in the well: but orbis suggests
rather the noticn of a horse running a race. Cp. Cic. Acad. 11.

135. pudor. The copyist will either be ashamed to aban-
don a method which he has once adopted; or if not, he will
find that it is impossible to deviate from the line which he has
taken up, without falling into incongruity.

136. nec—mespres. Horace appears to pass herc, by one
of his rapid transitions so common in this epistle, from the
drama to the epos, to which indeed the cautious of the last five
lines are almost as applicable as to the drama itself,

cyclicus ε Bentley adopted the form cycnus from some infe-
rior MSS„ but κύκλιος is never used in Greek in the sense for
which κυκλικός is the regular term, except once, and then pro-
bably sor euphony. The ‘Cyclic poets' were those epic poets,
who probably aster the Iliad and the Odyssey had assumed their
present form, wrote upon various legends, more or less closely
connected with the Theban and Trojan wars. They did not, as
has been erroneously supposed, intentionally write a cycle of
poems; but the grammarians put together by their aid a cycle
of legends. The'ir position and works have been exhaustively
discussed by VVelcker in his Episclzer Cyclas: there is a sull
account of them in Mure’s Lz'lcrature ‘ff Antient Greece, Vol. 11.,
and a brIefer one in Mahafi'y's Greek Lz‘terature, Vol. Ι. pp. 85
—89. The most noteworthy were Stasinus‚ Arctinus, Lesches,
Agias and Eugammus. The poet, to whom Horace here refers,
has not been identified. Perhaps indeed he had no particular
writer in view, but is censuring the lack of simplicity in the
school as a whole. In that case olim: alz'.q1m7zcl0 The line, it
is to be noted, contains nothing' m itself too high· flown, as some
have thought. Hence Peerlkamp thinks that the blame of Ho-
race is directed to the extrav agant language which he supposes
to have followed it, and Whichs would have been recalled to the
Pisos by his citation of the opening line. In that case, it would
be very odd that Horace should have omitted just that which he
thinks open to censure. But the line, though not extravagant
in itself, contrasts unfavourably with the modest and unassuming
tone of Homer's introduction. It has been noticed that the
first book of the Iliad is entirely without similes.
