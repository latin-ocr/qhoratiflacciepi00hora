Bk. 1. Ep. xvi] NOTES. 191

was probably Horace's Lueretilis, though some have found this
in the Monte Corrignaleto‚ above Rocca Giovane.

nl ‘except that‘: with continui we must understand smzt;
a general statement is made, and then a qualification is intro-
duced, which modifies it (Roby§ 1574, S. G. ἓ 654). The full
expression of the thought ‘would be ‘the mass of the hills is
unbroken, at least it would be, supposing they were not to be
parted by’ etc. Keller argues strongly in savour of the reading
si, which is found in some MSS„ and which he supposes
(though apparently without sufficient reason) to be implied in
Porphyrion's interpretation. He urges that the reading ni
implies that the estate consisted mainly of a mass of mountains‚
,and Schiitz admits this3 but I cannot see that this necessarily
follows. Even if it is too much to say with Kriiger that we
*must supply as predicate ‘are in the neighbourhood, surround
my estate ², there is no great ambiguity in beginning the descrip-
tion by saying ‘the mountains are unbroken’: Quinctius knew
that Horace lived in a mountainous district. keller takes si
*continui montes dissocientur as the protasis, and laudes as the
apodosis, which produces a cumbrous sentence, not in Horace's
style. Besides this strains the meaning of continui, which he
interprets as ‘separated only by a narrow valley'. He seems
also to be wrong in his view os the nature of the valley. He
regards it as running east and west, so as to be protected by the
mountains on the one hand srom the north wind, on the other
from the noonday sun and the scirocco. But the valley os the
Digentia runs nearly due north and south; and this is clearly
implied in vv. 5-6, dextrum must be used, just as we use
‘right bank’ of a river, sOr that part which is on the right hand
of one following the course of the stream. Thus the rising sun
shines on the slopes of the hills to the west of the river, which
face the east3 and the setting sun shines in the same way on
the slopes to the east. Kriiger thinks that the villa must be
regarded as facing the north, so that its right (eastern) wall
would catch the rising sun, but there is nothing to suggest the
villa as the standpoint. Some maps appear to mark a small
valley branching off from the valley of the Digentia, and running
east and west, just where the villa of Horace is placed by Rosa
(so Miiller in Sinith's Atlas and Piale’s Planta della Campagntz
Romamn but this is not well defined, and is several hundreds of
feet above the course of the stream. Hence it seems more pro-
bable that Horace is referring to the main valley.

sed ut, limiting: the valley is on the whole shady, but yet
such that the sun shines upon one side of it in the morning,
upon the other in the evening.
