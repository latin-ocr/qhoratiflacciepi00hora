Pacuvium vid’m· doctiorem, quiesse docti adfectant volunt. The
form Attius seems to be the one found in the best MSS. of
Quintilian (cp. Halm): on the other hand no MS. whatever has
that form here, and on Cic. de Orat. 111. 7, 27 Ellendt says ‘a
libris standum, qui, quod sciam, ubique sere tt ignoi·'.ant Cp.
Teuffel R.0m Lit. ἓ 119,1 ‘The equally uell- attested forms
Attius and Accius may be ouing to a dialectical difference [?].
In the Imperial period, the form nith tt gained the ascendancy,
and the Greeks aluays urote ”Αττιοςῖ It is singular that the
evidence should be so divided, seeing how rare it is to find ci
,and ti confused in early authorities Cp. Roby 1⁴. p. LII,
Corssen Aussprache 1. 50-67, 11. ¹003· Both' m Horace andin
Quintilian a few MSS. have Actius. Ribbeck in his Fragmenla
Jb‘affi’comcttz (1871) adopted the form Attius, but in his leiim.
Trag. (1875) he always has Accius.

Both Pacuvius and Accius attained to a great age, but pro-
bably senis means only ⁶ writer of the olden time' here, as in
Sat. 11. 1, 34, of Lucilius.

57. Afrani toga: ‘bene tq„ σα.- togatas enim scripsit Afranius'
Porph. The togatae uere comediez, depicting Ixoman or Italian
characters and manners, as opposed to the palleatae, cometlies
like those of Plautus and Terence derived from Greek sourceS,
and retaining Greek dramatis personae. L. Afranius was the
chief writer of togatae, born about 13.C. 1502 his plays were of a
very immoral character (cp. Quintil. Χ. 1, ιοο; Auson. Epigr.
LXXI. 4), but in style they attained to something of the elegance
of Terence. He freely borrowed from Menander, as wellas from
other writers (cp. Macrob. Sat. VI. 1, 4 Asi-anius togatarum
scriptor...non inverecunde respondens arguentibus quod plura
sumpsisset α’ Alenandro ⁶ fibteor', inquit ‘ sumpsi non ab illo modo
sed ut quisque habuit conveniret quod milti, quod me non posse
melius facere credidi, etiam a Latino') and the crities pronounced
that his style was worthy of his model.

58. ad. exemplar Epicharmi: Orelli justly says that it is very
difficult to determine the exact meaning of this line, because we
have not the means of comparing Plautus with Epicharmus, of
whose comedies we have few considerable fragments preserved.
He thinks that properare=ad eventum festinare (A. P. 148), and
that it refers to the rapid progress of the action of the plays. So
too Teuffel ἓ 97, 2. Schiitz understands it of rapidity of produc-
tion. Mahaffy says that it seems only to apply to the easy flow
of the dialogue’ (G7eek Lit. 1, p. 403); but Sellar is more nearly
right in extending it to‘ the extreme vivacity and rapidity of
gesture, dialogue‚ declamation and recitative, by which his scenes
were characterised’ (Roman Poets, p. 194). It must always be
remembered, though many critics seem to forget this, that Horace
is not giving rhis own opinions, but those w hich w ere commonly cur
