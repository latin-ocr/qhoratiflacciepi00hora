able for commerce, for it is neither on the sea, nor on a great
road. We may conclude however that probably the grain os the
valley of the Indus (a tributary of the Calbis), and the wood and
iron of Cibyra might furnish articles of commerce. Iron ore is
plentiful in the Cibyratis’. G. L. in the Dict. Geogr. Bithynia.
had some important ports, and large navigable rivers, which
brought down the produce of the interior, especially timber and
marble: cp. Carm. 1. 35, 7; 111. 7, 3.

34. rotundentur ‘be rounded off’, an expression not else-
where used, but Petron. 76 has uno cursu centies sestertium
coa-⁷¹0tzcndavi.—a.1tera a second set of talents‚ as numerou5‚
totidem being equivalent to mille talenta: cp. Catull. 5, 8 basia
mille, deinde centum, (lein mille altera, dein secunda centum.

35. quadrat is better supported than quadret, which seems to
be a careless assimilation to the preceding subjunctives: ‘the part
which squares the heap’ is a periphrasis for a fourth thousand.

and a riclz man z's better οβ’ than a king; so if llcis is your gaal,
push on towards it stoutly.

36. fidemque ‘ credit’3 not however, as Orelli says, solely in
money matters. Juv. 111. 143 qnantum quisque sua nummorum
servat z'n arca, tantum habet etfidez' (with Mayor’s note).

37. regina Pecunia ‘queen cash': Juv. Ι. 112 inter nos
sanctissima diviliarum maiestas, etsi funesta Pecunia templo non-
dum habitas. It is doubtful whether the references in Arnobius
and Augustine (quoted by Mayor acl loc.) to a dea Pecunia have
any better basis than such jests as these, although we must not
forget the very common tendency of the Romans to deisy
personifications. Cp. Mommsen 1. 173.

Brut. 15, 59 ut quam deam in Pericli labris scripsit Eupolis

39. cappadocum rex, Archelaus: Cicero says of his prede-
cessor Ariobarzanes in ad Att. VI. 1, 3 nullum aerarium, nullum
vectigal habet...nilzz'l illo reguo spoliatius, m‘lzil rege (gentius, and
ad Att. VI. 3, 5 erat rex perpauper. The Cappadocian slaves
were regarded as of little value: cp. Pers. VI. 77; Mart. Χ. 76, 3:
