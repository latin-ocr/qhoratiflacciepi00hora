were planted by Cimon, for ‘the Academy, which was before
a bare, dry and dirty spot, he converted into a well-watered
grove, with shady alleys to walk in, and open courses for races'
(Plutarch Cimon c. 13). Sulla in his siege of Athens is said to
have cut down the trees, but they must have been replanted by
this time. Plato had been wont to teach there, a custom followed
by his successors. Cp. Cic. de Fin. V. 1, 2 venit enim mz'lzz' Pla-
tonis in mentem, quem accepimus primum lzz'c dispulare solitum:
cuius etiam illi propinqui hortuli non memoriam solum mihi
afferunt, sed ipsum videntur in conspectu meo ponere. Hic speu-
sippus, hic Xenocrates, lzz'c eins auditor Polemo: cuius illa ipsa
sessio filit quam videmus. When Horace was at Athens the head
of the Academic school was Theomnestm, whose lectures Brutus
attended after the murder of Caesar (Plut. Brut. XXIV.). The
expression however seems to be here a general one for the study
of philosophy: Horace nowhere shows any special attachment
to the Academic doctrines ε he professes himself rather a follower
of Epicurus, though occasionally attracted to Stoic views of life
and the universe.

48. caesaris Augusti: so united only here by Horace: Vergil
has the title twice, Aen. VI. 793, VIII. 678.

responsura ‘fated to prove a match for’, with something
of the ironical humour which always marks Horace's references
to his military experience. Cp. Sat. II. 7, 85 responsare cupidi-
nibus, ib. 103, II. 4, 18, a usage apparently confined to Horace.

49. unde=ab armis. simul primum: a rare combination,
rejected by Gronovius and Drakenborch on Liv. VI. 1, 6 z'nlerz'm
Q. Fabio simul primum magistratu abiit, dies dicta est, and pro-

but sufficiently established by this passage. Simul (reprimunt is
used by Cic. in Verr. Act. 11. i. 13, 34, and by Suet. Caes. XXX„
Nero XLIII. Horace did not, like Pompeius Varus and other of
his friends, join the forces of Sextus Pompeius and continue the
struggle, but gave up arms at once.

50. inopem: Horace's father's estate had evidently been
confiscated aster the victory of the triumvirs.
