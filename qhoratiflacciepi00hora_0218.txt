182 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

1—25. You must tell me all about tlte climate, the foed, the
water, tlze game and fislc of Velia and Salernum ; for my doctor
tells me I may no longer winter at Baiae, much as the place
grumbles at my desertz'on.

1. sit. (like pascat in v. 14, bibant. in v. 15, educet. in v. 22,
and celent in v. 23) depends upon scribere in line 25. The
involved structure οἱ these lines, with their two long parentheseS,
is intended to preserve the negligent tone of a familiar letter.

Veliae, a town of Lucania originally founded by the
Phocaeans, when driven out of Corsica, where they had sor a
time found a home aster the destruction of Phocaea, about
B.C. 540. Its Greek name was Ὑέλη or Ἐλέα. It was a
prosperous commereial town, and was noted for its excellent
climate, so that Aemilius Paullus, the conqueror of Perseus, was
sent there by his physicians when suffering from a troublesome
disease (Plut. Aem. c. XXXV). The soil in the neighbourhood
according to Strabo (VI. p. 254) was poor (v. 14), and hence
the inhabitants lived largely by fisheries (v. 23). Not long
after its foundation it became the seat of the famous Eleatic
school (Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno). Salernum was a
Campanian town delightfully situated on the north shore of the
modern gulf of Salerno. It was of much importanee in the
Middle Ages, when it belonged to the Normans, and afterwards
to the Hohenstausem and the House of Anjou, and was the seat
of the greatest medical school in Europe. Some modern au-
thorities (e.g. Swinburne, Travels in tlze Two Sz'cz'lz'es,111. 185)
consider it unhealthy because it is screened from the north, and
exposed to the south wind, which brings up ‘most pernicious
miasma' from the plain stretching to the south, toward Paestum.
The town still has a population of over 20,000.

2. via: Horace would travel from Capua as far as Salernum
by the excellent via Popilia, a branch of the via Appia: he could
get on to Paestum (about half way to Velia) by a sair branch
road3 but there seems to have been no Roman road for the rest
of the way.

Baias: Ep. I. Ι, 83. The epithet liquidae applied to it in
Carm. 111. 4, 24 shows that the air of Baiae was noted for its
clearness: Cicero however (Ep. Fam. lx. 12) speaks as if there
were some at any rate whom it did not suit: gratulor Baiis
nostris, siquidem, ut scribis, salubres repenle factae sunt: nisi
forle te amant et tibi adsenlanlur, et tamdiu dum tu ades sunt
obll'lae sui. In any case Horace’s physician had forbidden him

v to go there, as he had usually done in the winter.

3. Antonius Musa, a freedman physician‚ had cured
Augustus in B. C. 23 of a serious livet complaint by the cold-
