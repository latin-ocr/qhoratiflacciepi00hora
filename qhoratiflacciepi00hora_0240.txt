204 HORA TI EPISTULAE.

245; the story is told by Diog. Laert. 11. 8, 68 παριόντα ποτὲ
αὐτὸν (Ἀρίστιππον) λάχανα πλύνων Διογένης ἔσκωψε καὶ φησίν,
εἰ ταῦτα ἔμαθες προσφέρεσθαι, οὐκ ἄν τυράννων αὐλὰς ἐθεράπευες.
ὁ δὲ καὶ σύ, εἶπεν, εἴπερ ᾔδεις ἀνθρώποις ὁμιλεῖν, οὐκ ἂν λάχανα.
ἔπλυνες. patienter ‘contentedly'. regibus, the words of Diog.
Laert. show that we need not take this in the more general
meaning of ‘the wealthy’‚ as in Sat. 1. 2, 86 :· the reference is in
the first place to Dionysius the elder, at whose court Aristippus
spent some time (Lucian Paras. 33). Orelli thinks that prandere
is used instead of cenare here, because lzolus was better suited to
the light dffeffizer than to the inore substantial dinner; but cp.
Ep. 11. 2, 168 emptum cenat holus, of one who is certainly not
poor. Resides it would weaken the point to say ‘if you could
make your lzgrlzter meal off vegetables’: if the difference is to be
pressed, surely the main meal of the day ought to have been
mentioned. Ritter rather daringly suggests that the Greek is
incorrectly recorded by Diog. Laert. and that a pun may have
been intended: εἰ ἅριστῴη Ἀρίστιππος λάχανα κ.τ.λ. But the
aor. ind. is the right tense, not the pres. opt. Hence we must
be content with supposing that Aristippus passed Diogenes in
the morning, when the latter was washing vegetables sor his
prandium. The modern Italian prandio or pranso is ‘dinner’
as opposed to colazione ‘breakfast', but the word seems never
to be used so in good Latin.

14. si sciret regibus uti: Orelli reminds us of the saying of
Epicurus (Diog. Laert. X. 121) καὶ μόναρχον ἐν καιρῷ θεραπεῦσαι
τον σοφον.

15. utrius: Horace has illi'us always with the exception of
Sat. Ι. 10, 67⁷ and so allcm'zts, ntri‘ns, utm‘ltsque, ulli‘us² uni‘zcs
(but nm‘zaes in Carni. JV. 9, 390, nullffus (but nullius in v. 22, and
inl. 1, 14). For Cicero’s practice cp. De Orat. 111. 47, 183
(note).

18. eludebat ‘parried': the reading illudebat has little
authlority and is unsuited to the passage, in which there is no
moc tery.

19. mihi ‘for rny own profit'. hoe ‘this conduct of mine’,
not referring to the latter of the two alternatives, but to that
which is nearer to the thought of the speaker. Cp. Sat. 11. 2,

29.

20. equus ut me portet: Bentley first showed clearly that
this goes with qfficiumsmio, not as previous editors had taken it
with est. The phrase was a proverbial one in Greek: ἵππος με
φέρει, βασιλεύς με τρέφεις cp. Diogen. Paroem. V. 31, where it
is explained as the answer os a certain Corraeus in service under
Philip, when his mother begged him to ask for his discharge.
