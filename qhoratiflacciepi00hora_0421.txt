‘Because of this rapid character it (the iambus) bade the name
‘trimeter' attach itself to the iambic lines, although, etc) For
the very common attraction of trimetris into the case of iambeis,
cp. Sat. 11. 3, 47 qm· tibi nomen insano imposuere. Roby ἓ 1059,
S. G. §441(b): accrescere denotes the gradual adhesion of the
name to that which is not properly denoted thereby.—But a
conjecture of Ribbeck's which substitutos momen sor nomen has
recently found much approval. He holds that Horace is here
describing three stages in the history of the iambicline : (ι) when,
as with the iambographers, the line usually, though not always
consisted of pure iambi v. 254: (ε’.) when, as in the Greek
dramatists, the pace was moderated, and spondees might be
found in the first, third and fifth places, v. 255: (3) when, as in
the Roman dramatists, spondees were sometimes found in every
foot but the last. He interprets them ‘Hence even to the
iambic verses (ἰαμβεῖα) of the iambographers which are to be
measured as trimeters, has the iambus so to say done violence,
by forcing upon it a quickened pace in excess of its natural
rapidity, by repeating six times the same foot’. Momm, con-
tracted for movz'men is either that which causes motion, or that
which is moved, or simply motion. The word is fairly common
in Lucretius, eg. VI. 474 e salso momine ponti, and was else-
where restored by Scaliger by a tolerably certain conjecture for
nomen: e.g. Manil. Ι. 34 momz'nczqueel cursus signorum, Aetna
2 1 3 spim'tus inflabit momen languentibus aere, on which cp. M unro's
note. This conjecture and the interpretation therewith con-
nected were accepted by Keller in his editio minor of 1878,
but· in the Epilegomena (1880) he returns to the MS. 'text-
Kr'riger 1⁰ (Anhang p. 384) also appi-oves. Schiitz on the other
hand rejects it : and 1 think rightly. The point to be explained
is why a verse consisting of six feet should be called a trimeter
verse : and Ribbeck's conjecture goes no way towards explaining
this. Nor is it easy to see to what previous stage of the verse
the iambus added a quickened pace, even if we assume, which
is far from certain, that a line with six beats in it is more rapid
than one with three. Finally the more frequent occurrence os
pure iambic lines in writers like Archilochus, Simonides of
Amorgos and Hipponax, is by no means established by their
extant fragments: it rests solely on the testimony of gram-
marians, which perhaps means no more than this, that the
iambographer sometimes wrote poems in pure iambics, as we
know was done by Catullus (lv. xxiv.) and Horace.

254. primus ad extremum: cp. Ep. 1. 1, 54 (note). non
1ta pridem. These words present a very grave difficulty, sor-in
the earliest iambics known, written 600 years before this time,
spondees are found frequently in the uneven places. Cp. Archil.
