Bk. 1. Ep. xvi] NOTES. 189

atque optime constitutas. The wealthier Romans possessed a
surprising number of country seats. Cicero was never accounted
a very rich man; but he had fourteen or fifteen, eight of them
of considerable size and beauty. (Watson select Epistles, p. 127.)

EPISTLE XVI.

The tone adopted in vv. 17 ff. of this Epistle makes it pretty
clear that the Quinctius, to whom it is addressed, was a man
younger than Horace. The eleventh Ode of the second book is
addressed to a Quinctius Hirpinus; and it has been argued
from the mention of cani capilli in v. 15 of that Ode that this
Quinctius must have been at least as old as Horace. But it is
probable that the reference there is only to the poet himself,
and that the levis iuventus of v. 6 is more applicable to his
friend. There is therefore nothing to prevent us from supposing
that the Ode and the Epistle are addressed to the same man.
He appears to have already attained conspicuous success in his
ambitious career3 and may with some probability be identified
with T. Quinctius Crispinus, the consul of B.C. 9. (The sur-
name Hirpinus of Carm. 11. 11 presents difficulties as yet
unsolved: cp. VVickham’s Introduction.) Chronology, as well
as his character as optimus, prevents us from identifying him
with the worthless T. Quinctius Crispinus, praetor in ΑΛ). 2:
but Orelli thinks that he rnay have been his father. The Epistle
cannot have been written before B.C. 27, when Octavianus
received the title of Augustus (v. 29); as Horace was in posses·
sion of his Sabine estate by B.C. 33, and as Quinctius at this
time knew very little about it, this goes to show that the friend-
ship between Horace and himself was not of long standing.
There is nothing to fix the date more precisely.

It lies in a skady valley .· tlze climate z's good, trees abundant, and

1. ne, not imperative, but dependent on scribetur (v. 4).
Quincti, the form found on coins of the Augustan time: the
great majority of MSS. have Quinti, but some (including the
vet. Bland.) have retained the earlier form.

2. arvo, properly land prepared for corn, but not yet sown:
cp. Varro R. R. 1. 29, 1 seges dicitur quod aratum satum-est;
arvum, quod aratum necdum satum est: but the word is com-
monly used for corn-land generally. Mr Simcox (Hz'st. Rom.
