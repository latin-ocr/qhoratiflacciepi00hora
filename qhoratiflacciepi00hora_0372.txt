336 Ales POETJCA.

malunt (pictores), caeruleum sublinunt, mox purpurissum ex ovo
inducunt. Bentley objected to plumas as denoting only the
feathers covering the body, not the wing-feathers, which he
thought the context required. The distinction though usually
is not always observed, and is not in question here: the
monstrous sorm is represented as having the body of abird, which
would be covered with plumae.

3. undique collatis membris, probably the dative aster
inducere, not the abl. abs. (as Orelli thinks), sor the indirect
object afterz'nducere can hardly be spared: sicis understood from
the following ut, as in v. 8 etc. ‘and to spread feathers of
varied hues over linibs brought together from all sides in such a
way that’ Sec. Ritter places a comma at plumas, understand-
ing inducere simply of the horse's neck (with et ei understood),
and taking collatis membris as abl. abs. This leaves the body
undescribed.

turpiter atrum go together, as in Ep. 1. 3, 22 tmpiter
ln'rlum: atrum=jbedmn ‘hideous': Ep. ΙΙ. 2, 189.

4. in piscem ‘in beluam marinam, i.e. pistricem’ Acron,
whence some have read atram...z'n pristim: cp. Verg. Aen. 111.
427 postrema immani corpore pistrix of Scylla, X. 21 1 in pristim
desinit alvus of Triton. [For the form of the word cp.
Nettleship on Aen. 111. 427.] But the general term is at least
as good as the more specific one, if not better.

5. spectatum ‘to a private view ', of course the supine.

7. aegri seems to have rather more authority than aegris
which Keller defends, and it is a better parallel to cuius. vanae
‘unreal’. Cp. Ep. 11. 1, 210 (note).

8. fingentur is required afterfore, by the sequence of tenses,
notfingnnlur. '

species ‘fancies’z vanae species, as Schiitz points out, are not
in themselves blaxneworthy in a work of imagination: only they
must not be inconsistent, like the dreams of a man suffering
from sever.

nec pes nec eaput, a metaphor suggested by the comparison
with a picture. Cp. Plaut. Asin. 729 nec caput nec pes sermoni
adparet. Capt. 614 garriet quoi neque pes umquam neque caput
compareat. Cic. ad Fam. V11. 31, 2 tuas res ita contractas, ut,
quemadmodum scribis, nec caput nec pedes.

uni proleptic : ila ut una fiat.

9. reddatur ‘is adapted to'. ‘Natura rerum dat, poeta
reddit ut debituin’ Or.
