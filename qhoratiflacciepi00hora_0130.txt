94 ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE.

86. fecerit: auspicium ‘has lent its sanction ἐ the auspicium
was properly the indication of the will of heaven ε hence there is an
intentional oxymoron in thejuxtaposition of libido and auspicium,
the thought being like that in Verg. Aen. IX. 185 an sua cuique
deus fit dira cupido? The auspicium never suggested an action
(ep. Mommsen R'om. Staatsrecht2'3 1. p. 73 ff.), but only indicated
approval or disapprovalz hence ‘has prompted him' would not
be an adequate rendering. The fact that he wishes sor a thing is
a sufficient proof to him that it is right for him to have it.

Teanum sc. Sidicinum, an inland town of Campania, about
30 miles from Baiae, where it was now his whim to have a villa.
There was another Teanum in Apulia. Acron’s notion that
Teanum ‘abundans optimis fabris' was the home to which the
workinen were suddenly bidden to return, is not probable.

87. tolletis, perhaps future sor imperative (Roby ἓ 1589,
S.G. ἓ 665 (bJJ, but it Is at least as probable that the words are
used by Horace himself, not put into the mouth of the erus.
This view is taken in the text.

1ectus genialis ‘a marriage-conch ³, sacred to the Genius of
the family, where he provided that the house should never be
without offspring. Cp. Preller Rom. Myth. p. 69.

aula, properly ‘ front-court ³, herezatrium ‘ hall '‚ where the
lectus genialis was placed, opposite the door (hence called adver-
sus Propert. V. 11, 85, Laberius in Gell. XVI. 9).

88. prius ‘preferable’, a meaning for which Cicero would
have used antiquius, e. g. quod honestius, id ni ilii est antiquius (ad
Att. V11. 3): cp. Vell. ΙΙ. 52, 4 neque prius, neque antiqm'us
quidquam habuit quam, ete.

caelibe: cp. Quint. Ι. 6, 36 ingenioseque visus est Gavius
caelibes dicere veluti caelites, quod onere gravissimo vacent,
idque Graeco argumento iavit: ἠϊθέους enim eadem de causa dici
(infirmas, a theory which Quintilian justly includes amongfoedz's-
sima ludibria. The word seems to admit of etymological expla-
nation as ‘lying alone’ ε cp. Vanieek p. 156.

89. bene esse, ‘it is well with '.
90. Protea. Sat. 11. 3, 71. Hom. Odyss. 1v. 455·

91. cenacula ‘garrets’t Varro de L. Lat. V. 162 ubi
cauabant, cenaculum vocitabant: posteaquam in superiore parte
cenitare cooperunt, superioris domus zaziversa cenacula dicta.
The word is never used in its original sense of ‘ dining-room'. Cp.
Mayor on Iuv. X. 18.

lectos, ‘ his seats’‚ apparently in the tavern which he
frequents sor his meals: he does not possess lectos of his own,
any more than balnea. But cp. Ep. Ι. 16, 76.
