note on ad st7 epztum‘ quia adhibemus sonitum citharae ac lyrae,
ut facilius sopiamur’ is a clear proof that he read somnum. Cp.
Carm.111. 1, 20 non avzum citharaeque cantus somnum reducent.
It is a strong argument too that we need the mention of some
act, which is blameworthy, whereas to relieve one’s cares by
song can hardly be so considered (cp. Carm. 1V. 11. 35).
Besides, the transition is then more abrupt to what follows,
which is an appeal against undue indulgence in sleep. Hence
there is much probability in M unro ’s mereatum ducere somnum
(Journal of Philology lx. 217) to bting on (or to lengthen) re-
newed sleep '. He defends this reading against the charge of*
tautology after V. 30 by pointing out that dormi‘re is properly‘ to
keep one’s bed' . The argument that curam is very awkward
after curanda, used in a different sense, appears to me to point
rather to its being the genuine reading3 as this awkwardness
would be more lil ely to strike a critic, and to suggest an attempt
at emendation, than to be introduced gratuitously. Cp. note on

Ep. 1.7 7, [6. With Munro I have printed the current reading,
but with much doubt.
