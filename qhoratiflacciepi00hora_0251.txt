20. Minuci via: this road is mentioned again in Cic. ad
Att. IX. 6: cohortesque sex, quae Albae fuissent, ad Curium
Minucia transisse. Now by comparing Caes. B. C. 1. 24, where
the same fact is mentioned, with c, 15 of the same book, it is
clear that the cohorts were not at Alba Longa, but at Alba on
the Fuciue Lake. Hence Macleane has quite a wrong conception
of this road when he speaks of it as running between the via
Latina and the via Appia, about half-way between Tusculum
and Aricia. ,Indeed a glance at the map wilt show that there is
no room for a high road between the via Latina, which runs
along one side of the Mons Albanus and the via Appia, which
passes under the other. The via Minucia must therefore have
been either another name sor the via Valeria, which led through
Tibur to Alba and Corfinium, and so on to the sea at Aternum,
or perhaps more probably sor a part of it. From Strabo (VI.
p. 283) we learn that there were two roads from Beneventum to
Brundisium, one, the Appian road, passing through Tarentum,
and better adapted for carriages, the other adapted only for
mules, passing through Herdonia, Canusium and Egnatia. The
latter was that taken by Maecenas and his suite on the journey
described by Horace in Sat. Ι. 5. Mr Bunbury (Dict. Geog. 11.
1282 a) thinks it ‘ not improbable’ that this was the Via Minucia:
Schutz (on Hor. Sat. 1. 5, 77) states the same view positively;
Prof. Palmer suggests that the road from Beneventum to Canu-
sium was a cross-road connecting the two great roads. This
last view is the only one which Ι can reconcile with the words
of Cicero taken in connexion with Caesar’s accon-nt. The nature
of the country does not admit of a road straight from Alba to
Beneventum, and there is no indication of such a road in the
Itineraries. The statement of some editors that the Via Minucia
was constructed by Ti. Minucius the consul of B.C. 305 (Liv.
IX. 44) seems to rest on no authority, and is withdrawn by Orelli

in his later editions.

21. damnosa: ‘ruinous', ‘partim ut Ep. ΙΙ. 1, 107 damnosa

enervant. Ov. ex Pont. Ι. 10, 33 vires adimit Veneris damnosa
