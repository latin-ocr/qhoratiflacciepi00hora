Bk. 1. Ep. 1v.] NOTES. 1 15

elegies confirms the impression of his character which we derive
from the language of Horace. He appears as a gentle, tender,
somewhat melancholy soul, marked more by genuineness of
natural feeling than by learning or force of expression. Carni.
1. 33 is also addressed to him. The date of the Epistle cannot
be precisely determined: there is no reason to suppose that it
immediately followed the publication of the Satires, none os
which are probably later than ΠΟ. 30, and the tone is not that
which would be adopted in addressing a very young man. It
may therefore be safely placed within the limits assigned to the
Epistles generally, B.C. 24—20. At the same time the absence
of all reference to the odes points to a date not long, isat all, aster
their publication. Ritter ingeniously endeavours to fix the date
to the beginning of B.C. 20; he argues that Augustus read the
Satires of Horace for the first time after his return from Asia
in September B.C. 19, when he made his well-known complaint
that the poet had made no mention of his intercourse with the
emperor, that Ep. X111. was a reply to this complana, and that
it was written in B.C. 18. But Tibullus could not have been a

critic of his satires before they were published. There are too b( · 2ss

opposed to niger, as we find the word used in Sat. 1. 4, 85.

2. Pedana: the town of Pedum seems to have disappeared
even in the time of Horace3 it is not mentioned by Strabo
and Pliny (111. 69, 30) ranks the Pedani among the Latin peoples
who interiere sine vestigiis.

est qui in partibus Cassi et Bruti tribunus militum cum Horatio
militavit, quibus victis Athenis se contulit. Q. Varus ab Augusto
