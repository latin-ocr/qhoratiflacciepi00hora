400 ARS POETICA.

350. quodcumque minabitur, sc. ferire: Madvig (Adv.
crit. 1. p. 68) writes ‘neque enim Horatium a. p. 350 scripsisse,
quod omnes toties legi1nus...(in quo durissime ita auditur infini-
tivus, ut adiiciatur etiam se: quodcunque se percussurum
esse minabitur; nam minari aliquid longe aliud est), hoc,
inquam, eum non scripsisse ostendunt codices, in quibus est,
fide quidem dignis omnibus, quocunque, hoc est, quoicun-
que.’ The confusion between quod or quo (from quoi) and
cui is a common one in MSS. (cp. Madvig Emend. Lz'ze.2,
p. 350, Roby 11. p. xxxiii). But Madvig is in error in sup-
posing that quocunque has good MS. authority here: it ap-
pears in none of the MSS. collated by Keller or by Ritter, and
the only trace of it which I have been able to discover is in the
inferior Berlin cod. 269 quoted by Schiitz. Hence it is perhaps
better to keep to the unusual construction which is not unintelli-

gible, rather than to depart from the MSS. minor is a stronger
expression ἴον-πω.

352. offendar, sut. ind. rather than pres. subj. aut...au†,:
it would seem at first that there is not sufficient distinction
between the sources of error for the strongly disjunctive par-
ticles: but incuria appears to reser to saults arising simply from
carelessness, parum cavit to those due to the difficulties of the
task‚ against which sufficient care had not been taken.

353. quid ergo est? ‘How stands the case then?' Bentley
restored the est, which earlier editors had omitted, asserting
that quid ergo alone is used only when it is a kind of rhetorical
introduction to a following question; ‘what then?’. It is doubt-
ful whether this dictum would bear examination, except for
Cicero. Cp. Reid on Cic. Acad. Ι. 4, 13.

354. scriptor librarius, ‘a copying clerk'‚ a slave set to this
employrnent by his owner in order to produce books either for
his own library or sor sale. Cp. Marquardt Ram. Privata-dt. Ι.
p. 157.

355. quamvis ‘however much’: for the construction cp.
Ep. Ι. 16, 63 17, 1, 22

[et] citharoedus: Bentley read ut, which is good in itself, but
has very slight authority.

356. ridetur: Roby§ 1421.

357. multum cessat, ‘often neglects his duty': Ep. ii. 2,
14. choeriluS, Ep. 11. 1, 232.

358. bis terve, ‘twice‚ or even thrice', whereas bis terque
(v. 440) is ‘twice‚ ay and thrice:' the formerzraro, the latter:
saepe: cp. Bentley on Epod. V. 33. where he rightly restored
bis terque. Here most MSS. have bis terque, which Keller and
Schiitzretain, attempting without much success to combat
Bentley's distinction.
