288 ΗΘΚΛ Τ] EPISTULAE.

even in the senatorial provinces he had an impmium maius, which
made their governors soi-mally subordinate to him. Hence the
‘iustus triumphus’ could no longer be enjoyed by successful
generals, who were only serving under his auspices, not under their
own. During the earlier part of his rule, he sometimes allowed
a triumph, but afterwards (apparently after 13.C. 15: cp. Furneaux
on Tac. Ann. Ι. 72) this honour was reserved to members of the
imperial house. Cp. Suet. Aug. XXXVIII. nec parcior in bellica
virtute honoranda, super triginta dea-ilaus iustos triumphos et ali-
quanto pluribus triumphalia ornamenta decernenda curavit ,· and
c. XXI. domuit partim ductu partim auspiciis suis Cantabriam,

Aquitaniam, Pannoniam, Dalmatiam cum Illyrico omni,· item
Raetiam et Vindelicos ac Salassos.

255. Ianum: cp. Introduction to this Epistle.

256. Parthis: Carm. Saec. 53 iam mari terraque manus
potentes Medus Albanasque timet secures: Sat. 11. 5, 62 iuvenis
Parthis horrendus: Ep, Ι. 12, 27.

257. cuperem, attracted into the tense of possem.

258. recipit ‘admits of'. Cp. Suet. Aug. LXXXIX ingenia
saeculi sui omnihus mortis fovit .· ruitantes et benigne et patienter
audivit, nec tantum carmina et historias, sed ct oratioms et dialo-
gos. Componi tamen aliquid de se nisi serio et a praestantissimis
ffndebatur‚ admonebatque praetores, ne paterentur nomen sunm
commissionibus [‘prize declamations'] obsolefieri. The term
maiestas was properly applied to the people as a whole, but even
Cic. in Pis. 11, ²4 uses it osa consul, magna maiestas consulis:
in Phaedr. 11. 5, 22 tum sic iocata est tanta maiestas ducis the
term is not so much used as a title, as in accordance with Phae-
drus's well-known preference for abstract words.

l259. ferre recusent: cp. A. P. 39 quidserre recusent, quid
va eant umeri.

260. stulte, quem diligit, urguet: this punctuation, adopted
by Bentley and most recent editors, is undoubtedly better than
that which connects stulte with diligit. This would be very
inappropriate‚ if referred to Augustus.

262. discit, sc. aliquis, to be supplied from the quis in the
relative clause.

264. m] moror: Horace puts himself for the moment in the

place of the emperor: ⁴ I care nothing—and therefore I am sure
that you do not ’.

officium = sedulitas above.

ficto in peius voltu: cp. Plin. Ep. V. 10 pictores pulchram
absolutamque formam raro nisi in peius effingunt. Aelian has
