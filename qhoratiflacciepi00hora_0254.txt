218 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

like Lucretius might be accepted with little hesitation. whether
it is legitimate in Horace is a question which depends upon the
view taken of the general soundness of the traditional text.

38. tortus: cp. Carm. 111. 21, 13 tu [se. merum] lene tor-

menlzmz ingenio admoves plerumque duro: A. P. 435 torquere
mero.

ira: surely the irritation felt by Lollius, if ever his patron
treated him with harshness or injustice‚ though some take it of
angry threats used by those who wish to learn the secret.

39—66. Do not oblrzcde yom‘ own pltrsuz'ls, or disparagre and

avoid tlzose qf your patron. Yon are well able to dtlrtinguish
yourself in hunting σν tlte gamas.

39. aliena, here those of the patron.

41. Amphionis. Euripides in his Antiope introduced Am·
phion and Zethus the two sons of Antiope as at variance on the
value of music, and in an extant fragment (188 Dind.) Zethus
remonstrates with his brother: ἀλλ’ ἐμοὶ πιθοῢ’ παῦσαι μελῳδῶν,
πολεμίων -δ’ εὐμουσίαν ἄσκει· τοιαῦτ’ ἄειδε καὶ δόξεις φθονεῖν,
σκάπτων, ἀρῶν γῆν, ποιμνίοις ἐπιστατῶν, ἄλλοις τὰ κομψαὶ ταῦτ’
ἀφεὶς σοφίσματα, ἐξ ὢν κενοῖσιν ἐγκατοικήσεις δόμοις. The story
was familiar to Roman readers from the Antiopa of Pacuvius,
perhaps the most famous aud admired of his plays (cp, Sellar’s
Roman Poets of tlte Republic, p. 136, Ribbeck’s Rffmz'sclze
Tragb'die, pp. 281—301) : Cicero speaks of Zethus in Pacuvius
as almost declaring war upon philosophy (de Orat. ΙΙ. 37, 155),
and of Amphion ‘qui, vituperata musica, sapientiam laudet’
(de Inv. 1. 50, 94: cp. ad Herenn. ΙΙ. 27, 43, de Rep. 1. 18,
30). Ritter points out that in works of art Zethus is sometimes
represented as a shepherd, sometimes as a hunter.

gratia—dissiluit ‘the friendship was severed '-

42. suspecta, as leading to effeminacy. severo: Prop. 1v.
(111.) 15, 29 et durum Zethum et lacrimis Amphiona mollem.

46. Aetolis, a ‘literary’ epithet, recalling the famous Caly-
donian hunt. For the significance of such epithets cp. Sellar's
Vergil, p. 235 f. The reading Aeoliis first suggested as a
conjecture hy Ulitius (Vliet), has since been found in an inferior
Ms„ and has been adopted by Meineke and other good editors.
It is explained as a reference to the very fine but strong nets
made of the flax grown near Cumae (Plin. H. N. XIX. 1, 10),
a colony from Cyme in Aeolia. So Gratius (Cyn. 35) has
Aeoliae de valle Sibyllae. But Bentley justly remarked that it
was impossible sor Horace to have used such a far-setched ex·
