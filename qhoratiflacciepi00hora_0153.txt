⁷. dederunt: Sat. Ι. 10, 45; Corssen 1². 612; Neue Formen-
lehre, 11¹2. 392. Roby§ 577, S. G. ξ 274. Here, as usually with
this quantity (cp. XVagner on Verg. Georg. lv. 393), some MSS.
have the pluperfect. »

8. quid voveat, &c. ‘what greater boon could a nurse
implore for her dear foster-child, if he could ⁷, ἃς. The earlier
editors made a muddle of this passage, by reading (with very
slight authority) quam for qui, supposing the expression of a
comparison to be needed after maius: this involved the further
change of et cui into utque, and the insertion of ut after pari, all
quite gratuitous changes. The suppressed comparison is ‘than
he already enjoys, supposing that he’, διε.

9. sapere et fari ‘to think aright and to utter his thoughts’3
cp. Pericles in Thue. 11. 60 οὐδενὸς ἥσσων οἴομαι εἶναι ’γνῶναί τε
τοὶ δέοντα καὶ ἑρμηνεῦσαι ταῦτα. The affection of a foster-mother
is proverbial: the wisdom of her prayers is doubted by Persius
11. 39, and Seneca Ep. 60 (quoted there by Casaubon). possit
Roby§ 1680, S. G. ἓ 704.

10. contingat Ep. 1. 2, 46.

11. mundus ‘decent' : Sat. 11. 2, 65 mundus erit qui [qua ?]
non effutiat sordibus: victus may be tenuis, yet not sordidus (ib. v.
53); cp. Ep. 11. 2, 199. Carni. 11. 10, 5 ff. Corn. Nep. Att. 13, 5
omni diligentia munditiam non affluentiam affi’clabat. Some MSS.
have et modus et which is only a corruption of mzidus: but on
the strength of this Bentley prints et domus et. crumena: Juv.
XI. 38 quis enim le deficiente crumena el crescenle gula manet
exitus.

12. inter...iras ‘in the midst of', not felt by Tibullus
himself especially, as some have supposed, but marking human
life generally. Cp. note on Ep. 1. 6, 12.

13. diluxisse, etc. ‘that every (lay which breaks is your
last': dilucesco is less common than illucesce, but cp. Cic. Cat.
111. 3, 6: the former describes the light as breaking tlzrouglz
the clouds, the latter as shining upon the earth.

14. grata. Ter. Phorm. 2 51 quidquid practer spem eveniet,
