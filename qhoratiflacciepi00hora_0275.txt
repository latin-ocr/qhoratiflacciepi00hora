Bk. 1. Ep. XX] NOTES. 2 39

7. quid volui? Verg. Ecl. 11. 58 lecu, heu! quid volni
misero mihi ,9

ubi quid: the great preponderance of MS. authority is here
in favour of quid, and Keller admits that it must have been
found in the archetype, though he is inclined to think it an
error for quis, which Yonge, muer, Selium, Kriiger, L. Muner
and Orelli all retain. It is certainly more natural to have quis,
referring to amalor: but perhaps qnid may be defended of an
act, rather than a thing.

laeserit still keeps up the double reference: cp. Ov. Her.
v. 103 nulla reparabilis arte laesa pudicitia est. ,

8. in breve te cogi: applied to the book this means ‘that
you are rolled up and replaced in your case ’3 in its reference to
the young slave it means ⁴ that you are brought into sad straits ’.

Cp. Ter. Haut. 669 ltac re in angustum oppido nunc meae
coguntur copiae.

plenus ‘ sated ².

9—18. You may be lz‘ked well enough when you are young,
but tlce time will come ‘zaben you will be neglected‚ or sent out of
tlte counlffy ,· ancl a dz'smal old age awaits you.

9. quodsi...aug·ur ‘if the prophet [i.e. Horace] does not
lose his foresight in his vexation with the offender'.

10. deserat, the reading of the archetype, may well be
defended, as expressing the anticipation in the mind of Horace
that it will be so. . Cp. A. P. 155 sessuri donec cantor...dicat.
Bentley allows deserit to stand in his text without remark, but
this is barely possible, and has little authority. Cp. Ep. 1. 18,
61, Roby§ 1664, S. G. ἓ 692. deseret would stand, but it has
very little support in MSS. Perhaps we should see here an
early instance of the construction so familiar in Tacitus (Drager
Hist. Synt. 11. 585) where donec is regularly used with the sub-
junctive without any suggestion os either expectation or purpose.

aetaS, ‘youth '‚ rarely so used, unless the context clearly
points to this meaning: in most, if not all the passages quoted
as parallel, e.g. Ter. Andr. 54, 286, ‘time of life’ is a better
translation: but Cic. de Off. 11. 13, 45 tna aelus incidit in ia'
bellum is a clear instance of this soree. So ὥρα in Greek and
aetatula in Plautus. For iniens aelas cp. Halm on Cic. de
Imp. Pomp. ἕ 2.

11. sordescere, ‘to lose your bloom ⁹.

12. tineas: cp. Sat. 11. 3, 118 cni stragula vestis, blattarum
ac tinearum epulae, putrescat z'n arca: Ov. l’ont. 1. 1, 72 conditus
ut tineae carpitur ore liber. ⁴
