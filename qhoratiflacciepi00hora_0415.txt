ness’ is ingenious: and he defends it by Carm. 111. 5. 12 incolumi
lovcet urbe Roma, and Mart. v. 10, 7 Ennius cst lectus salvo tibi,
Roma, Asamum but in the former passage this meaning is very
improbable, while in the latter the point of the epigram ab-
solutely requires that we should interpret ‘during the life-time
of Vergil ’. It is not more possible for incolumis to bear this
sense (although even Mt· Yonge admits it) than it would be for
usto say that a man was saring well, to indicate that some one
had said ‘farewell’ to him. ⁷

temptavit, the form best supported orthographically seems
to be due to an early popular confusion with conlemptus, etc.
Etymologically the form should be tento, as a frequentative from
tendo. Cp. Roby §964. Corssen 1.2 122.

223. morandus: ‘spectator grata erat novitate retinendus,
qui veniebat post sacrificia iam pransus, iam potus’. Acron.

224. functusque sacris: Dramatic representations at the
Dionysiae festivals began very early in the morning (cp. Arist.
Av. 784 ff„ Aesch. in Ctes. p. 467, Dem. in Mid. p. 538): it is
commonly said that the satyric dramas were exhibited towards
the evening: this is quite inconsistent with the prevalent doctrine
as to the productiori of plays in tetralogies, unless, indeed, each
poet had a whole day to himself, as Bergk (Gr. Lit. 111. p. 24)
thinks; but consider-ing the slight support which that doctrine
has (cp. Journal of Plu'lology VII. 279—292) this is not a serious
objection. Bergk holds (Gr. Lz't. 111. 19 ff.) that originally
comedies only were produced at the Lenaea, and tragedies at
the Great Dionysia, but that at a later time the comedies were
preceded by tragedies‚ and the tragedies by comedies, so in-
terpreting the law quoted by Demosthenes in Mid. p. 518. If
this is correct, at least at the Great Dionysia, the satyrio dramas
may have been played towards the evening, when they no longer
formed part of a tetralogy (if they ever did). That they sre-
quently were played independently is clear from the statement
of Suidas that Pratinas wrote fifty plays, of which thirty-two were
satyric.-—-We do not know when the sacrifices, with which a
banquet was always associated, were offered: perhaps during the
interval for the second or later ἄριστον (Bergk 111. p. 31), which
may have corne between the tragedies and the satyric dramas.
At the Dionysia it was considered the duty of all loyal wor-
shippers of the deity to drink freely, ‘and reeling own the mighty
wine-god's power’ (Becker Charicles, p. 178). Cp. Plato Leg. Vl.
775 πίνειν δὲ εἰς μέθην οὔτε ἄλλοθί που πρέπει, πλην ἐν ταῖς τοῦ τὸν
οἶνον δόντος θεοῦ ἑορταῖς.

exlex, i.e. ready to defy all laws, with no reference to any
special enactment.
