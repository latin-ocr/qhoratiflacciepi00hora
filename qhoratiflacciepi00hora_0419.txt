NOTES. 38 3

241. sudet, v. 413, Sat. 1. xo, 28 exsudet causas. Orelli
well quotes Pascal Pensdes 1. 3 Les mcillcurs livres sont ceux
que chaque lecteur croit qu'il aurai! pufin're: and KVieland says
that these lines contain ‘one of the greatest mysteries of art,
which Horace could blab very confidently‚ without searing that
he was betraying anything to the ἁμυήτοις’. But the mystery
has no special reference to the satyric drama.

242. series: cp. v. 46 in verbis serendis. 1unctura. v. 48.
The parallelism gives strong support to those who take carmen
to refer to the language, not to the substance.

243. de medio sumptis: cp. Cic. Or. 49, 163 verba legenda
sunt...non ut poetae exquisita ad sonum sed sumpta de medio:
cp. de Orat. 1. 3, 12 in medio posita, 111. 45, 177 iacentia sustu-
limus e medio. Quint. v. 7, 31 verbis quam maxime cx medio
sumptis, ut, qui rogatur, intellegat, aut ne intellegere se neget.
This phrase too may be used of the matter, but is more naturally
taken of the language.

244—250. Iftlze Ezuns use tlze language of tlte slreels, tlze
better class ofllze audience will be cff‘ndetl.

244. deducti sc. in scaenam.- so Acron rightly explains it.
Fauni, virtually the same as the Satyrs, though corresponding
more exactly to the Πανίσκοι, who along with the Satyrs attended
upon Bacchus. Cp. Ep. Ι. 19, 4.

245. ne velut innati trivfls : the Fauns are not to speak as
if they were natives of the city, and so sall into one of the two
opposite vices of language, affected sentimentality‚ and disgrace-
sul coarseness. It has been supposed that innati triviis and
forenses are opposed to each other, the former denoting the
vulgar rabble, the *latter the more educated men, who could take
part in the business of the law-courts ; in that case there would
be a clzz'asmzcs, the former referring especially to v. 247, the
latter to v. 246. But there is no sufficient authority sor the force
so assigned to sorensis, and ac would require to be replaced by
aut. ‘Born in the streets and almost dwellers in the sorum' is
simply a phrase for townspeople. But there is probably also a
reminiscence of the Greek feeling against spending too much
time in the ᾰὙορά; cp. οἷ’γοραΐος, περίτριμμα ἀγορᾶς etc. (Act. Ap.
XV11.5: Plat. Protag. 347 E: Liv. subrostrani). Cp. fizctio
fhrensis in Liv. lx. 46, 13.

246. iuvenentur, a word coined doubtless by Horace, on
the analogy of augurari, auspicari, interpretari, velitari etc.
(Roby ἓ 961), to represent νεανιεύεσθαι or μειρακιεὺεσθαι. The
word might denote the spirit and vehemence of youth, as when
Aristotle Rhet. 111. 11, 16 says εἰσὶ δὲ ὑπερβολαὶ μειρακιώδεις·
σφοδρότητα -γὰρ δηλοῦσιν. But the context shows that it is used,
