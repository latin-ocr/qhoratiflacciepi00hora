13.c. 20. Is there any-thing to point to a later date
than this? In the Epistles themselves there seems to
be nothing. It is a very doubtful conjecture which
finds in Ep. i. 17, 33—35 a reference tov the triumphs
of Augustus and Agrippa in B.C. 19. But we have
also to take into consideration the relation of the
Epistles to the Odes. It seems pretty well established
that the first three books of the Odes were published
together, before any of the Epistles3 indeed, the lan-
guage which Horace uses in Ep. i. 1, and the refer-
ence to imitators in Ep. i. 19, alike ‚force us to the
assumption of a tolerably long interval between the
publication of the Odes and that of the Epistles. Now
the date of the publication of Odes i.—iii. does not
admit of exact determination. There are arguments
which seem to point very strongly to ΒΕ. 24 or 23:
there are other-s which have been considered to point
to 13.C. 19 (cp. Wickham’s Introduction to the Odes,
Christ's Fastorum Horalz‘anorum Epicrisis, Kirchner's
Quaestiones Horatianae, and Franke’s Fasti Horatiam).
But on the whole the evidence for the earlier year
decidedly preponderateS. It is therefore probable
that we may assume B.c. 20, or at the latest Rc. 19, as
the date of the publication of the first book of the
Epistles¹.

1 If we are to accept Mr Verrall’s very ingenious, but *not
very convincing argument for the publication os Odes i.——iii.
in 13.C. 19, it is not necessary perhaps to alter the date of the
publication os the Epistles; but it would affect the interpretation
of two or three passages in thern. ”
