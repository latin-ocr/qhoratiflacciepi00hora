136 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

copfidence.1t is by no means certain that Ep. 11. is to be
assigiiEH to Β. C. 21. Horace was doubtless osten at Pr,aeneste
and perhaps spent more winters than one by the sea. Frankxe
with not less probability assigns both this epistle and Ep.

to Β. C. ¹23. Sir T. Martin well remarks: ‘This Epistle wIill
always rank among the most valued of Horaee's poems. It
shows the man in his most attractive aspect, —simple, frank,
affectionate, tactical manly, and independent. No one can
read it without feeling that dear as Maecenas was to Horace,
and deeply grateful to him as he was for his generosity, and
sor the friendly spirit without which generosity itself would
have been odious to the poet not even for him would Horace
sorego a tittle of that sreedom of thought and action which he
deemed to be essential, not less for 1115 self- respect than for his
personal happiness'.

1—13. I have slayed away from Rome mnclz longer than
J told you J should .· but l am sure you will excuse me, Maecenas,
fhr I am afraid lo be in loton at sltclz an unlzealllzy season. J
intend lo go down to tlze senfin* tlze winter, but Islzall be back again
with you in tlze spring.

1. quinque djes; ‘five days or so ', a colloquial phrase, for
xxiiim-t period: cp. Sat. 1. 3, 16 quinque diebus nil erat in

rure: this form for the locative ucri occurs again in Ep.
1.14, 10, twice in Ovid and twice in Tibullus. In Plaut.
Trin. 166 it is found in the MSS. though Ritschl reads 7202
(cp. Cas. I. 22), and Madvig le‘urs it 1n Liv.V11. 5, 9, XXXV111.
53, 8. With an epithet the form utre is always used. Cp.
Ktihner 11. 354. Roby ἓ 1168‚1170. There is nothing to
fix the meaning here to Praeneste, as Ritter supposes, or to
Tibur, as others have argued from V. 45. Horace may probably
refer rather to his Sabine farm.

2. Sextilem: this month received the name ‘August' in
B.c. 8 (Dion. Cass. LV. 6), cp. Merivale IV. 255.

desideror: Roby, ἓ 14603 S. G.§ 596. atqui: most MSS.
have fallen into the very common error of substituting alque.

3. sanum recteque valentem, ‘free from disease, and in
sound health’ as in Ep. 1. 16, 21. Cp. Cic. Acad. 11. 7, 19
sz' [sensus] et sani sunt ac valentes. The reading of some inferior
MSS. recteque vzdme valentem is due solely to the wish to fill
up the gap left by the aceidental omission of sanum ; Bentley' s
suggestion recteque vigere valentem 15 needless.
