ius, or ‘rules of law’, legal provisions, either contained in the
XII. tables, or added by the praetors. Cp. Dict. Ant. s.v. Ius:
and Gaius Ι. 2 constant autem iura populi Romani ex lembus,
plebis consultis, constitutionibus principiali, edictis corum qul ius
edicendi habent, responsis prmlcnlium.

42. iudice: in private suits a single indat decided questions
of fact, aster a praetor had put the case into the proper form for
hearing, and settled any question of law involved. Cp. Gaius

xv. 39-43·

43. res sponsore. All MSS. except the vet. Bland. have
responsore, which Ritter in vain endeavours to defend. Bentley
showed convincingly that responsor is never used for qui iura
respondet, and that if it was, the word would be out of place
here, sor a good man is not required to be a learned lawyer.
But sponsor is the regular word for one who stands as surety,
and thus secures a man his property. Cp. Corn. Nep. Att. 9

nullum stiterit vade'monz'mn sine Attico, sponsor omnium rerum

causae: the sorm caussa (like cassus and dz'vissioncs) was
used, according to Quint. 1. 7, 20. in the autographs of Cicero

45. introrsum is supported by much better authority than
introrsus, which Bentley prefers for the sake of euphony: some
inferior MSS. have lzunc prorsus.
