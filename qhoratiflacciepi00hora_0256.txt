61. exercitus, ‘ your forces ', i.e. of slaves. Actia pugna:
Verg. Aen. viil. 675 Actia bella and elsewhere: the more
regular form Actiacas is used by Ovid. Met. XIII. 715, XV.
166, and in prose.

62. hostili more, i.e. quasi re vera hostes inter vos essetis.
63. 1a0u8, i.e. the lake on your father's estate.

64. velox, ‘swift’ as being winged, in accordance with the
usual representation os Nike or Victoria in works of art. There
is probably no reference, as Ritter thinks. to the rapidity with
which the battle of Actium was gained. Cp. Sat. 1. 1, 8.

66. utroque pollice: cp. Plin. H. N. xxvi11. 2, 2 5 pollices,
cum faveamus, premere eliam proverbio iubemur. The opposite
to this is pollicem vertere: cp. Juv. 111. 36 verso pollice volgi,
cum libet, occidunt populariter. It is not quite clear what
gesture is denoted by the two expressions. Mayor on Juv. 1.c.
writes ‘those who wished the death of a conquered gladiator
turned (vertebam, convertebant) their thumbs towards their
breasts, as a signal to his opponent to stab him: those who
wished him to be spared turned their thumbs downwards (pre-
mebant), as a signal for dropping the sword'. But others take
premere as ‘to close⁷z so Ritter and Schiitz‚ and if I mistake
not, Georges in his Lexicon (‘den Daumen einschlagen’):
L. and S. have the vague phrase ‘to close down': white ‘to
press down ’. In Prop. 111. (IV.) 10, 14 et nitidaspresso pollice
finge comas, the phrase evidently means simply ‘ pressing your
thumb upon them'. The versus pollex is also called infestus
(Quint. XI. 3, 119), and from App. Met. ΙΙ. c. 21 (Hild.)
it is plain that this means ‘upturned’: paz-rzjgrz't (ίεχίεναυι, et
