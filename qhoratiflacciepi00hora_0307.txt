cruento ‘that drew blood'.

152. super. This use of super sor de is not ¹found in good
prose between Cato super talc· re, and Livy, except in Cicero‘s
letters (e.g. ad Att. x. 8, 10 sed stac super re nimis), where he
often adopts the more conversational style os the comedians.
From Plautus five instances are quoted. Cp. Dr'agen ffl'st.

lex: the first law enacted as to mala carmina was that passed
by the decemvirs in the Twelve Tables: cp. Cic. de Rep. 1v.
10, 12 nostrae XII tabulae cum perpaucas res capite sanxissent,
in his lzanc quoqne sanciendam putaverunt, si quis occentavisset
sive carmen condidisset, quod infamiam faceret flagitiumve alteri.
There was in the time of Horace a further lex Cornelia, passed
by Sulla in B.C. 81, de iniuriis, which included libellous pub-
lications. As the punishment was capite, it seems that fustis
refers to the old punishment of the fustuarium or cudgelling to
death.

153. lata. The'phrase serre legem meant properly only to
‘bring forward’ a law, not to carry it, which is perflrre: Cic.
Cornel. Fragm. 13 (Baiter) est utiquc ius velandi, cum lex

establishing this difference, has no authority, because the reading
given is only due to conjecture (cp. Ascon. p. 70 Orell.): but

between the proposal of a law and the passing os it, firre was
occasionaliy used sor the latter; cp. Cic. Corn. Frag. rr (the
senate declares) quae lex lala esse dicatur, ea non videri populum
