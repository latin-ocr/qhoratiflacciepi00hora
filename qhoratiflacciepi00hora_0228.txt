192 ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE.

descendens. Bentley read decedens, quoting in support Verg. Ecl.
11. 67, Georg. 1. 222, 1v. 466, and Ep. 1. 6, 33 but it is not
necessary to depart from the MSS.

vaporet may mean simply ‘ warms ’ as often in Lucretius vapor
means ‘heat’ (cp. v. 1 131); but perhaps it is better to interpret
with Orelli ‘tepido vapore obducat’.

8. quid, si ferant, sc. dicas. The subj. pres. does not here
suggest that the hypothesis is merely imaginary, but ferant is
attracted into the mood of dicas: ‘if you were to learn this, you
would say ’, Sto. Bentley reads ferunt and iuvat, which would
be necessary if dicas did not follow, suggesting the same form to
be supplied after quid. Macleane's comma aster umbra, instead
of a note of interrogation, makes the construction unintelligible.
Prof. Palmer believes the true reading to be quid quod here and
quod for η’ in v. 9: quod then fell out aster quid in v. 8, and
before quercus in v. 9. Several good MSS. omit si and have ct
in v. 9, and some have quodsi here, which facts seem to point to
some corruption. Certainly quid sz' as it stands here, seems
quite unparalleled. In that case, we must of course read serunt·

benigni has better authority, and is more poetical than
benzgrne: some MSS. have benignae: Lucretius IV. 60 uses
vepris as a feminine, and Priscian (V. 8, 4²) says that the gender
was common with ‘vetustissimi'3 but Vergil (Georg. 111. 444,
Aen. V111. 645) and Columella treat it as masculine. Munro
thinks that the evidence points to the feminine here (note on
Lueret. 1. c.)6though he prints benzgnz'. Cp. benzgrnus ager Ov.
Am. 1. 10, 5 .

9. vepres ‘bushes': usually thorn-bushes‚ as in Verg.
Georg. 111. 444 hirsuti secuerunt corpora vepres; but not neces-
sarily, nor apparently here, for although the sloe-tree (prunus
spinosa) has thorns, the wild cherry (cornus mascula) has not. A
senatus consultum in F ront. Aquaed. 129 has arbores, vites,
vepres, sentes. The wild cherry is indigenous in Italy, although
the cherry proper was only introduced in Cicero's time. For
sloes cp. Plin. N. H. XV. 13, 44 pruna silvestria ubique nasci
certum est.

10. fruge, here equivalent to glandibus, but in Cic. Or. 9,
30 of corn contrasted with acorns: ut inventis frugibus glande
vescantur.

11. Tarentum: the charms of Tarentum are sung of in
Carm. 11. 6, 9—20‚ where Horace places it next to Tibur.
Lenormant (La Grande· Grece Ι. 20) writes of the little village of
Citrezze near Tarentum, with its little chapel of S. Maria di
Galeso: ‘la beaute des eaux, et l’ombrage (les arbres touffus,
creent une sensation de fraicheur dont le charme, sous ce climat
