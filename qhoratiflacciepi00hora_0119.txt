Bk. 1. Ep. 1.] NOTES. 83

writes nobilis gladiator post mullas palmas consecratis Herculi
Fundano armis tandem in agellmn se contulit: there seems to be
no positive evidence that gladiators were regarded as under the
protection of Hercules; but this god would be as naturally
selected by a gladiator, as the nymphs by a fisherman Anth. Pal.
11. 494 or Hermes by a hunter ib. 1. 223· A soldier similarly in
Anth. Pal. Ι. 241 says: δέξαι μ’, Ἡράκλεις, Ἀρχεστράτου ἱερὸν
ὅπλον, ὅφρα ποτὶ ξεστὰν παστάδα κεκλιμένα ’γηραλέα τελέθοιμι.
Cp. Carm. 111. 16, 1 1. As the temple of Hercules at Fundi was
well known, it does not follow, as Ritter thinks that the ager must
have been in its neighbourhood : the term is here quite general,
‘in the country.’ For the case cp. Roby ἓ 1174, S. G. ἓ 489.

6. extrema. harena, i.e. at the outside edge os the circus,
under the podium, where the more distinguished spectators had
their seats. Acron tells us, though possibly without any authority
beyond that of this passage, that gladiators who were suing for
their discharge (petituri rudem) used to betake themselves to the
edge of the arena that they might the more readily prevail upon
the people by their down-cast looks, a phrase singularly at
variance with what we leam elsewhere of the pride which they
took in their profession. Cp. Friedlander Sitteng. 113 p. 363. Most
modern editors accept this view, but it is open to grave objection.
Veianius, Horace says, hung up his arms in the temple of Her-
cules, and retired to the country, abandoning altogether his 'pro-
session. Why? That he might not have so frequently to implore
the people to request his master to give him his discharge? But
he must have received his discharge already, if it was possible sor
him to retire. Why then continue to beg for it? But we know
from Suet. Tib. 7⁰(mztnus gladiatorz'mn dedit, rudiarii? quibus-
dam revocatz's auctoramento centenum milium) that veterans who
had received their discharge were sometimes induced to re-appear
on special occasions. Veianius after his discharge, retired al-
together that he might not after so many victories‚ break down
and be compelled again and again to appeal as a defeated com-
batant for the mercy of the spectators. The desire that mercy
should be shown to a defeated gladiator was expressed by turning
down the thumbs (Plin. XXV111. 2, 5 pollices, cnm finieramus,
premere etiam proverbio iubemur: cp. Ep. 1. 18, 66, Juv. 111. 36
with Mayor’s note). The illustration thus becomes more closely
parallel with the metaphor of the racc-horse which follows.

As exoro has in itself always the meaning ‘to prevail uponl',
we must here press the imperfect force of the present ‘ attempt to
prevail upon': Roby§ 1454, 3, S.G. ἓ 591.

7. purgatam, ‘well rinsed‚’ for which purpose vinegar was
sometimes used, as we learn from Pers. v. 36. qui: sor the
‘ inner voice’ cp. ib. V. 96 slat contra ratio et secretam gannit in
aurem.
