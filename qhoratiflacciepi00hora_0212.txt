6. Lamiae pietas et eura ‘Lamia's love and trouble’: this
cannot mean, as some have taken it, ‘my love for Lamia’ z pictas
seems never to be used with an objective genitive, and it is
doubtful whether it could denote an affection not based upon any
natural ties, such as exist in the case of parents or kinsmen.
L. Aelius Lamia is the man to whom Carm. 111. 17 is addressed,
and who is also mentioned in Carm. Ι. 26, 8. Η6 was of a
noble and wealthy plebeian family (cp. Juv. IV. 154, VI. 384, Tac.
Ann. Vl. 27), and attained the consulship in A.D. 3. He held
high office under Tiberius, and was honoured with a public
funeral when he died in A.D. 33. The name of Q. Aeiius Lamia
occurs on a coin of this date, and this appears to be the brother
here referred to. Lucius must have been the elder brother, as
he bore his father's praenomen, but he must himself have been
young at this time, sor we cannot date this epistle less than
about fifty-five years before his death, and as he was appointed
p1·‹z<y‘i·cszts maz* in A.D. 32 he cannot have attained extreme old
age, though Tacitus speaks of his vivida seneclus. The date of
Carm- Ι. 26 is uncertain, but is probably as early as B. C. 30.

moratur has much more authority than moretur. Quamvis
is followed by the indic. also in Ep. 1. 17, 1 and 223 18, 593
Sat. 1. 3‚129‚ ΙΙ. 2, 293 5, 153 Carm.1.28,11‚111.7‚ 253 ιο,
133 A. P. 355; by the subjunctive only in Carm. 111. 11, 17, IV.
2, 393 6, 6: Ep. 1. 18, 92, 11. 2, 113 (where see notes) the
word is twice used adverbially. Vergil uses it only twice with
the indic. (Ecl. 111. 84, Aen. 542), but often with the subjunctive,
once at least adverbially (Aen. V11. 492). Livy frequently uses
it adverbially‚ twice with the indic. (ΙΙ. 40, 73 XXXIII. 19, 2),
never with the subjunctive. Ovid often has the indicative. So

have Celsus and Nepos, both prose writers, probably contern-
poraries of Horace.

7. maerentis—dolentis: the assonance is doubtless acci-
(lentalz cp. note on Ep. 1. 12, 25. Macreo is to express grief,
doleo is to feel it: cp. Cic. ad Att. XII. 28, 2 maerorem minui,
dolorem nec potui, uec, si possem, vellem.

8. insolabiliter, a ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. About 80 of these have
been noted in the works of Horace. istuc ‘where you are now',
i.e. to the woods and fields. mens animusquezvofis καὶ Gumis:
‘mens meliora intellegit, animus adesse cupit’‚ Ritter, ‘my judg-
ment and my heart'.

9. fert ‘would sain hurry mc’: amat ‘would gladly’: cp.
Carm. 111'. 9, 24 lecum vivere amem. Bentley’s conjecture avet
is thus needless.
