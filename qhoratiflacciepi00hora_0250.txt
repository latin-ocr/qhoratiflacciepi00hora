214 HORATI EPISTULAE.

for armatus, comparing Accius V. 308 ed. Ribb. ut nunc, cum
animatus iero, sales armatus sum. Schiitz takes propugnat
absolutely, and joins nugzs asmatus: ‘he maintains his own
view, with no other weapons than nonsense’, which seems very
harsh. The conjecture of Withof, which Keller approves, pro
pugno ‘instead of a fist' is perhaps the worst that has been
suggested.

cle lana caprina: most commentators take this as a pro-
verbial expression sor something non· -existent, and quote as
parallel Lucian Hermotim. §71 (p. 818) πάντες, ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν,
περὶ ὄνου σκιᾶς μάχονται ol. φιλοσοφοῦντες. Surely an ass has a
shadow! (Cp. Ar. Vesp 191, vshere the scholiast explains the
origin of the proverb.) Porphyrion shows better judgment. ‘de
villo ut quidam dicunt, caprorum, pilos non setarn dicens esse,
sed lanam’. He is ready to come to blows on the question
whether goats' hair, used sor weaving into eloth (czleczum cp.
commentators on Acts xviii. 3, or Farrar 's Szzz'nt Paul 1 23), is
properly to be called wool or not. According to the Roman
jurists 1t was. Cp. Heumann Handlex. s. v. In Ar. Rau. 186
however we have ἐς ὄνου πόκας as equivalent to Utopia: cp.
the commentators there. For rzxa of an interchange of blows
ep. Tac. Hist. 1. 64 iurgia primum, mox rixa: Cic. de Orat.
11. 59, ²40 (note), Mayor on Juv. XV. 5²3 111. 288.

16. scilicet ut ‘ to think that ἐ Horace is fond of this phrase,
using it five times in the Epistles, but nowhere quite in this
sense. Cp. Sat. 11. 5. 18 utne tegasn spurco Damae latus? But
perhaps, as scilicet is very rare in interrogative sentenceS, we
should read seilicet: ut, i.e. ‘ to be sure l the notion that &c ’0

17. non sit mihi prima fides ‘ I should not be believed

before every one else’. vere, with placet, not with elatrem‚
which is already provided with acriter.

18. sordet: Ep. Ι. 11, 4. Ritter and others put a comma at
elatrem‚ not a note of interrogation, thinking that ut non sz't
and ut non elatrem both depend on sordet, in the sense of ‘on
the condition that ', but this is very awkward. The abruptness
of the text is much more pointed. ‘I would not care to have
my life over again at that price'.

19. Docilis has much more authority than any other form,
is recognized by the scholiast, and is found elsewhere as the
name of a sreedman. Dolichos ‘Long ’ would be suitable enough
as the name of a gladiator, if it had more authority. The old
commentators were divided in opinion, according to Porphyrion,
as to whether Castor and Docilis were actors or gladiators; but
as they seem to be matched, the latter is the more probable.
