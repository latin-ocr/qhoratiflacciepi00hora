386 ARS POETJCA.

attempts have been made to remove the historical inaccuracy.
Some have suggested that non ita pridem might mean ‘ not long
after', a notion quite without support. Others have assumed that
the reference is only to Latin iambic verse, as written in the time
of Horace, but then it is not less incorrect as a historical state-
ment. Ribbeck suspects a lacuna, containing some such words
as ‘it was not long ago that [the iambus appeared in this form
here and there with us: but with the Greeks etc.]: and Schiitz
sears a serious corruption. But the difficulty is best solved by
supposing‚ with Orelli, that Horace is giving, not a historically
exact, but rather an ideal sketch of the development of the verse,
describing its various stages as they ought to have been in theory,
rather than as he had reason to know that they had been.
Iambic lines ought to have been originally pure, and afterwards
to have admitted spondees. Mr Reid ingeniously suggests that
we should read non ita: pridem etc„ ‘Not so: long ago’ as in
Verg. Aen. 11. 583. But there a question precedes.

256. paterna: Ribbeck cannot get quite clear about the
ancestry of the iambus, and therefore prefers with C. F. Her·
mann the conjecture of a certain Dutchman, alterna. This is
to miss the spol-tive tone of the whole passage, in which the
iambus is made to give orders, to welcome, to be obliging and
long-suffering, and to act in friendly sashion. A foot that can
do all this, may surely be allowed ‘hereditary rights’.—Horace
omits to mention the last place, to which of course the iambus
also held tenaciously. Peerlkamp has thought it necessary to
remedy this omission, by reading sextam, sed for socialiter.
This last word is another of the ἅπαξ λεγόμενα which are so
common in this Epistle. It means ‘admitting into partner-
ship ’. Perhaps a comma should be placed at quarta, so that
non...quarta may be parenthetica]-

258. hic sc. iambus, not, as some have taken it, as an
adverb. nobilibus ‘famous’‚ here ironical. Horace means that
the iambus appeared so rarely that they were hardly deserving
to be called iambic trimeters3 in some of the extant fragments
there are lines which consist wholly of spondees, with the excep-
tion of the last foot. But L. Miiller Ennius p. 243 denies that
this censure is on the whole justified.

260. cum magno: this position of the words, for which
Vergil would certainly have written magno cum, along with the
spondaic character of the line produces a rhythm which imitates
t e sense.

262. premit, sc. iambus, or rather its rare appearance: cp.
Liv. 111. 13, 1 premebat reum praeter volgatam invidiam crimen
unum.
