Orelli's quotations from Arrian’s Epictetus I. 6, ΙΙ. 16, 13, &c-
imply however that the existence of catarrh was an objection
brought by some against the perfectiori of nature as taught by
the Stoics‚ answered by pointing to the provision nature had
made for the removal of it: hence the meaning may be ‘except
when a cold in the head troubles you '-

EPISTLE ΙΙ.

This epistle is addressed to Lollius Maximus, probably the
elder son of M. Lollius, to whom Canu. Iv. 9 was afterwards
addressed. The date of the Epistle is not certain. The
eighteenth epistle of this book is also addressed to the same
Lollius, and we learn from that (v. 55) that he had served under
Augustus in the Cantabrian war of B.c. 25—24. It is not
improbable that aster serving (as puer) in that war, he returned
to Rome, and took up again the practice of declamation, just
as Cicero did after his service in the Social War. In that case
B.C. ²3 would be a plausible date to assign; but the use of
puer in v. 68 is not inconsistent with a date a year or two
later. The practice of rhetoric under teachers was often carried
on long after the years of manhood had been reached. Cicero
was studying under Molo at the age of twenty-eight. The
date of Ep. XVIII. is fixed by v. 56 at B.C. 20, and that appears
to be certainly later than the present one.
