Bk. 11. Ep. Π] NOTEs. 323

181. argentum, here clearly ‘plate’z cp. Ep. 1. 2, 44
(note). Gaetulo: ‘Afro‚ ac per hoc Mauro: significat enim
purpuram Girbitanem' Porph. The geographer Pomponius
Mela 111. 1 1 says Nzgrritarum Gaetularmnque passim vagantium
ne litora quidem infecunda sunt purpura et murice efficacissimis
ad tingendum. The island os Girba (inodernJerbah) or Meninx,
as it was earlier called, lies to the south-east of the Lesser Syrtis.
The Lotophagi were said to have lived there: but it was not
near the territory occupied in historic times by the Gaetulians,
who extended to the sea only to the S.W. of Mauretania. (At
the same time we may notice that Juvenal xlv. ηδ’-9 places
the Gaetula aequora to the east of Calpe, and that Strabo (xvn.
p. 829) makes the Gaetulians extend as sar as the Syrtes.) It
was here mainly that the purple fish was found (Plin. v. 1, 1¹7.
cum ebori citro silvae exquirantur omm's scopuli Gaetuli muricibus
purpuris: VI. 31, 201 nec Mauretaniae insularum certzbr filma
est: paucas modo constat esse ex adverso Autololum a Juba re-
pertas, in quibus Gaetulicam purpuram tinguere instituerat:
IX. 36, 127 Tyri praecipuus lzz‘c Asiae, Alenz'nge Africae et
Gaetulo litore oceani, in Laconica Europae. Porphyrion is
therefore in error in supposing that Horace puts Gaetulian
for Girbitan purple: the former was the more famous of the
two. Cp. Carm. 11. 16, 35 te lais Afro murice tinctae vestiunt

lanae.

182. curat: the indic. is much better established here than
the subj. But if Horace had meant, as most editors say ‘the
wise man’, could he have used the indicative? Orelli's ex-
planation ‘quia certum est, indicativo utitur, cum illud sunt qui
non habeanta casu tantum pendeat ’‚ is not satisfactory. The
poet rather denotes himself: ‘I know one at least who does
not care to have’. So Conington rightly takes it, and
Dr Kennedy in the P. S. G. p. 456. Cp. Roby ἓξ 1680, 1681,

S. G. ἐξ 703, 704.

183. cessare: Ep. Ι. 2, 313 7, 57. Brothers unlike in cha-
racter and tastes are common enough in history and in fiction:
but probably Horace was most familiar with the pairs who
appear in the Adelphi and the Hautontimorumenos of Terence.

184. Herodis, i.e. Herod the Great who reigned B.C.
39—4. The most famous pahngroves‚ according to Pliny, N. H.
v. 14, 70 were near Jericho: ffi'erz'cuntem palmetis consitam,
sontibus riguam. Strabo XVI. 2, 41 says ofJericho ἐνταῦθα δ’ ἐστὶν
ὸ φοινικών, μεμιγμένην ἔχων καὶ ἄλλην ὕλην ἥμερον καὶ εὔκαρπον,
πλεονάζων δέ τῷ φοίνικι, ἐπὶ μῆκος σταδίων ἑκατὸν διάῤῥυτος ἅπας
καὶ μεστὸς κατοικιῶν· ἔστι δ’ αὐτοῦ καὶ βασίλειον καὶ ὁ τοῦ βαλσάμου
παράδεισος. Tacitus too (Hist. v. 6) speaks of the palmetis
proceritas et decor in Judaea.
