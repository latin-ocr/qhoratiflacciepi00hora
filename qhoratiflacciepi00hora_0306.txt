270 HORATI EPISTULAE.

Campania seems to lend some support to this local origin of the
term. But on the whole the second explanation is to be pre-
ferred, though not quite in the form given (from Festus) by
Paulustfascz'nmn denotes primarily the evil eye, but as this
was supposed to be aver-ted by the use of an obscene symbol,
fascinum came to be a synonym sor the symbol itself. As the
effects of the evil eye were especially to he dreaded in marriage
the chanting of obscene verses was considered an essential part of
the nuptial ceremony‚ and it was almost solely in this connexion
that the Fescennine verses survived in the later days os the
Republic. Cp. Catull. LXI. 120 ne din taceat procax lv‘esccnnina
{acatio (so Munro: Ezscenm'na locutio Ellis): Sen. Med. 113 festa
dicax fundat convicia fflsccnm'nus: and see Munro's Crz'tz'cisms
and Elnct'dations os Catullus, pp. 76-—78. The abusive songs,
however, by which soldiers tried to avert the srowns of Fortune
from a general during his triumph, were of the same nature, and
the term was occasionally used of scurrilous verses of any kind :
cp. Macrob. 11. 4, 21 malpel-ibus lm'umviralibus Pollio cum Fes-
cenniuos in enm Augustus scripsisset, ait at ego taceo, non est
enim facile in eum scribere qui potest praescribere, ib. 111. 14, 9
Cato senatorem non z[gnobllem spatiatorem et F escenninum vocat.
Cp. Nettleship in Jourtz. Plcil. XI. 190.

inventa. Bentley, on the ground of the assumed Etruscan
origin of these verses, read invecta, objecting at the same time
to the phrase invenire licentiam. But the foreign origin is
exceedingly doubtful: it is impossible (with Teuffel. Rom. Lit-
ἓ 5) to combine the two derivations of the term Fescenninus,
and the form which the word takes is due probably only to a
popular etymology, like that which has given us Jerusalem
artichoke for gz'rasole (Max Miiller Lectm-es 11. 368), while, as
Schiitz justly says, it is difficult to see what other word Horace
could have used sor invenire. Besides, the custom of rustic merry-
making‚ such as is described by Verg. Georg. 11. 385-392,
would more naturally give rise at home to this interchange of
sportive and licentious abuse, than lead to its importation from
abroad. We have specimens of this rustic abuse in Theocrit.

147. accepta ‘handed down ', from one year to another,
as the time of harvest came round. This is perhaps better than
Orelli's ‘ welcorne ', which would however be a persectly legitimate
sense.

148. amabiliter ‘in friendly sashion‘. iam saevus ‘now
growing savage’.

- 149. coepit verti :it is not necessary (with Schiitz) to defend
this construction, by pointing to the middle force of verti.
Although in classical prose coepms sum is as a rule used with a
