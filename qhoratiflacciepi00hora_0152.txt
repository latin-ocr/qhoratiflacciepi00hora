1 16 HORA TI EPISTULAE.

Actium, although from Acron's note it would appear that he did
not understand it so, for Cassius served both with Sex. Pompeius
and with Antonius against Augustus. The letter in Cic. Ep.
Fam. ΧΙΙ. 13 is perhaps from this Cassius (Drumann ΙΙ. 161—163)‚
but cp. Ramsay in Dict. Biog. 1. 627 b. He is to be carefully
distinguished srom the Cassius Etruscus of Sat. 1. 10, 61,
although the Scholiasts all confuse them.

For opuscula ofliterary works cp. Ep. 1. 19, 35. It is used
in the same way by Cic. Parad. 5.

4. inter reptare: many MSS. write these as one word. But
MS. evidence on such a point is worth little, and the word is
quite unknown elsewhere. Cp. Carm. 111. 15, 5; ΙΙΙ. 27, 513
Sat. Ι. 6, 58—59; Epist. ΙΙ. 2, 93—943 A. P. 425 iuter noscere.

reptare ‘stroll': the frequently asserted identity of repo and
serpo is more than doubtful: the meaning differs, serpo never
being used of men, except metaphorically (A. P. 28), and repo
often, and the phonetic process assumed is supported only by the
doubtful parallel of νέίε (Curt. 1. 330, 44¹)-

salubris Ep. ΙΙ. 2, 77. Tibullus says of himself (IV. 13, 9
Epigr. i. Baehrens, p. 84) sic ego secretis possum bene vivere
silvis, qua nulla humano sit via trita pede.

6. eras : Many commentators take as z ἕφυςτ ‘nascenti tibi
non solum corpus sed etiam pectus eximium datum est.’ Ritter‚
which is hardly a possible force for the tense. Others explain
‘semper quamdiu te cognovi’. It is simplest to say ‘you used
not to be’, when we were together, which certainly does not
imply (as Macleane says) a doubt whether he is so still. Prof.
Palmer adds “Prop. 1. 13. 34: Non alio limine dignus eras.-
eraszes but stronger, ‘you are not and never were’. I think
the idiom is the same as in quanta laborabas Charybdi?

pectore, not, as Macleane says, sor the ‘intellect'‚ but the
‘soul’‚ including of course the mental facusties, but denoting
especially the emotional side. In his own quotation from
Quintilian (X. 7, 15) pectus est qnod disertos facit, et vis mentis,
the context makes this quite clear: habenda τἰι oculis, in adfectus
recipt'enda : pectus est enim etc....ict⁷coque imperitis quoqne, ,η’ modo
sunt aliquo adfectu concitati, verba mm desunt. Cp. the famous
saying of Augustine ‘pectus facit theolognm’. So in Ov. Met.
XIII. ¹290 rudis et sine pectore miles ‘a rough and soulless soldier’:
Her. XVI. 201—-2 lzzmrine lu speres hominem sine pectore dotes
posse satis fhrmae, Tyndari, nosse tuae? where it is a man with-
out a soul for beauty. Osten we may best translate ‘heart’‚
e.g. de Orat. 111. 30, 121. There are however instances where
the intellectual part seems the more prominent: e.g. Sat. 11. 4,
