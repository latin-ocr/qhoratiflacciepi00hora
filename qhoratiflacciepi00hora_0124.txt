Theocr. 43, ἐς τρὶς ἀποσπένδω καὶ τρὶς τάδε, πότνια, φωνω,
Tibull. Ι. 2, 54 ter cane, ter dictis despue carminibus, Hor. Carm.
1. 28, 36, Sat. 11. 1, 7. Libellus probably keeps up the allusion
in piacula, and is not without a reference to the books of magic

amatorem esse, alind amantem.

40. cunm-ae, Tusc. Π. 5, 13 ut ager quamvis firtz'lz's sine

ins reduxit), although Augustus reserved to himself the right of
nominating half the magistrates, and of exercising a veto upon
unworthy candidates. Cp. Merivale c. XLIV. (v. 230).

to be used somewhat generally for the body, but it is difficult
to find an exact parallel.

46. per mare, etc. proverbial expressions, not to be pressed
in detail, cp. Sat. ΙΙ. 3, 56, Solon Fragm. X111. (Bergk) 43
σπεύδει δ’ ἄλλοθεν ἄλλος· ὁ μὲν κατὰ πόντον ἀλᾶται ἐν νηυσὶν
