131. aegrum ‘sick at heart' as osten in Cicero.

132. cum pueris puella: unquestionably a reference to the
choirs of youths and maidens sor whom Horace had written the
Carmen Saeculare. In Carm Ι. 21 we have a similar, but brieser
hymn. Lixy xxvu. 37 describes how a chorus of twenty- seven
maidens sang 'hymns composed sor them by Livius Andronicus,
as they went in procession through the city, in honour ofJuno
Regina.

134. praesentia numina. ‘the favour of the gods ’. For

135. caelestis aquas: Carm. Saec. 31, 32 nutriant fi’tus et
aquae salubres et lovis aurae. The same expression is used sor
rain in Carm. 111. 10, 20.

docta ‘taught' by the poet: as in Carm. Saec. 75. blandus:
Carm. IV. 1, 8 blandae iuvenum precem 111. 23‚ 18 non sump-
tuosa blandiar hostia ; 1. 24, 13 Threicio blandius Orpheo. The
notion is that of winning favour by entreaty.

men met together τιμὰς ἀπονέμοντες τοῖς θεοῖς, καὶ αὐτοῖς ἀναπαύ-
