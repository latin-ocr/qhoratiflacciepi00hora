Bk. 11. Ep. 1.] NOTES. 281

Pltn. N. H. VIII. 18, 27 Camelopardalis dictatoris Caesaris Cir-
censIbus ludis (B. C. 46) primum visa Romae.

196. elephans albus: white clephants are proverbially very

” rare, being really albinocs. Even the famous white elephants

of Siam seem to be really of a slate colour. Cp. ‘ Daily News ’
sor Jan. 31, 1884. The form in -ans is that best supported
here, though doubtless the n was not pronouuced: but cp.
Brambach Lat. Orthqgrr. p. 267, Roby ἓ 495. S. G. ξ 166.—-
Bentley's converterit has very slight support, and would hardly
be defensible‚ isit had more. '

197. ludis ipsis=quam ludos ipsos: Sat. 1. 1, 97 se mm
unquam servo melius vestiret: Verg. Aen. Ι. 15 quam luno fertur
lerrz's magis omnibus unam coluisse. This usage with an adverb
seems limited to poets: cp. K'tihner Gramm. 11. 976.

198. 11111110 appears to have decidedly more authority than
the vulgate mimo, the vet. Bland. being here supported by sonte
of Keller‘s best MSS. It is also the reading which is apparently,
though not really, the harder, for it is doubtful whether mimus
can be used, as Orelli sayS, ‘pro quovis histrione’, and it is not
easy to see why Horace should not have used the plural sor the
actors on the stage. For plus nimio cp. note ou Ep. Ι. 10, 30.

199. asello surdo: Horace has packed two proverbial ex-
pressions into one, sor the sake of greater emphasis: cp. Ter.
Haut. 222 ne z'lle lzagcscit quam milli nunc surdo narretsallulam,
and Zenob. v. 42 ὄνῳ τις ἔλεγε μῦθον· ὁ δὲ τὰ ὦτα ἐκίνει· εἰς
ἀναισθησίαν τινῶν ἡ παροιμία εἴρηται. ’

202. Garganum: Carm. 11. 9, 6 aquilonibus querceta Gargani
laborant. The forests of Garganus have now almost entirely
disappeared, as is also the case very largely in the Apennines.

203. ludi, a term equally applicable to the ludi scaenici and
to the ludi circenses, so that we need not suppose with Orelli
any reference to the latter. artes ‘works of art’: Ep. 1. 6, 1 7.

204. oblitus ‘bedizened'; Mr Yonge compares Milton's
‘besmeared with gold' in Par. L. V. 356. The word is used in
the sense of ‘overloaded' in ad Her. xv. 11, 16 si crebrae
conlocabuntur [exornationes], oblitam reddent orationem ,· Cic.
Brut. 13, 51 eloqztcnlia...z'ta peregrinata cst tola Asia, ut se
externis oblineret moribus: so that Eekstein's conjecture obsum,
though neat, is needless.

2((J(3.t {iane emphasizing nil: ‘not a word’. Cic. de Orat. 11.

207. veneno ‘drug’‚ i.e. dye. The purple (murex) os Ta-
rentum was considered second only to that os 'l'yre (Ptin. xx. 39,
