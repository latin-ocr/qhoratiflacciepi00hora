210 HORATI EPISTULAE.

rauca: Porph. says ‘ad ravim', ie. ‘till they are hoarse‘,
which has found much support. But it is not easy to see why
the neighbours should bawl so long at the impostor, as to ruin
their voices over him. The word more probably denotes only
the harsh dissonant eries of the mocking crowd.

EPISTLE XVIII.

This epistle is in some MSS. and by the scholiasts taken as a
continuation of the preceding one, and the latter even speak of
‘Lollius Scaeva '. The only justification for this is that at first
sight the main theme, the manner in which an inferior should
associate with a superior in rank and wealth, appears to be the
same in both. But a little consideration shows that the position
of Lollius is very different from that of Scaeva. The latter is
evidently of narrow meanS, and probably of humble origin : his
object in courting a patron is to obtain a decent livelihood : the
former is in possession of an ancestral estate (v. 60) with a lake
on it large enough to be made the scene of a sharn sea-sight,
represented by two fleets of boats manned by numerous slaves.
The date is fixed by vv. 55—57 to B.C. 20: it is therefore ex-
ceedingly improbable that the epistle was addressed, as the
scholiasts say and as Ritter believes, to the Lollius who was
consul m Β. C. 21 (Ep. 1. 20, 28): but it may probably have been
addressed to his son. Lollia Paulina the wise of Caligula, was
the daughter of M. Lollius consulans according to Tac. ’Ann.
X11. 1. Pliny N. H. IX. 35, 118 speaks of her as the grand-
daughter of the consul of B.C. 2 ῐ. This latter statement is quite
in harmony with chronology, sor she was married to Caligula,
her second husband in A. D. 38, and in A. D. 49 was put sorward
as a candidate for the hand of Claudius: hence she can hardly
have been born before A. D. 10. The account given by Tacitus
is reconcileable with that of Pliny only on the assumption that
the son of M. Lollius the consul of B.C. 21 was himself consul
szfflctus, though his name does not appear in the Fasti, and
hence we cannot determine the date. if the reading maxime is
right ln Ep. 11. 1, the father of Lollius must have been the man
toz> whom the two epistles were addressed; for it was the custom
of the eldest son to bear his father s praenomen. If we read there
Λῐαχυηε, the identification remains probable, although there is
not the same evidence for it.

Bentley on v. 37 assumes that the powerful friend whom
Lollius courted was Tiberius ε but if this had been the case, it is
