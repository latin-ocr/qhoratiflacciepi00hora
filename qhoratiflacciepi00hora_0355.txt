MS. authority is 111 favour not of quondam, but of quoniam J and
Keller warmly defends this reading, placing a comma at olim,
and the note of interrogation at aenum. His arguments are
(1) that the position of qnondam makes its grammatical connexion
somewhat obscure; and (2) that quondam is not found with a
substantive until later Latin. The objections to quoniam are
(1) that it is rather a prosaic word, found only in the Satires
(Ι. 6, 223 11. 3, 201; 4. 25; 6, 52) though „used by Vergil and
other poets: (2) that it is much more in the style of Horace
to have a short rhetorical question, followed by an example,
than a long argumentative question, such as the retention of
quoniam would involve. A rhetorical question does not well
admit of the addition of the reasons, which determine the
answer. Resides, with a question ending at aenum, sed fol-
lows very awkwardly. The place which quoniam would take in
the line might be defended on the plea of metrical convenience.
But as quondam and quoniam would be represented in the MSS.
by almost indistinguishable atmreviations, their evidence need

not go for much: and the former clearly makes the better con-
structlon. ·

would be of more value than those at a distance from Rome.
Cp. Tac. Ann. xlv. 53 per lzacc suburbana incedit. Veii had
been lying in ruins since its capture by Camillus (B.C. 306), and
its land had been divided among the soldiers of Julius Caesar-in
B.C. 45. These formed a small colony, which was dispersed
during the wars of the triumvirs, and Propertius 1v. (v.) 10, 29
in a poem probably written about the time of this epistle speaks
of the land within its walls as given up to herdsmen and reapcrs.
