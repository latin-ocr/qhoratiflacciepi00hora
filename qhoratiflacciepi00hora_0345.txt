101. Mimnermus: cp. Ep. 1. 6, 65. Although Callimachus
(flor. B.C. 260—240) was ranked by some critics (e. g. Quintilian
x. 1, 58 cuius princeps habetur Callimachus, with Mayor’s note)
as the first of elegiae poets, Horace seems to have agreed with
Ovid, Am. 1. 15, 14 quamvis ingenio non valet, arte valet. In
any case Mimnermus (flor. B.C. 640-600) was the first to use
elegiae verse sor love poetry (cp. Prop. 1. 9, 11 plns in amore
valet lllimnermi versus Homero), and it was naturally a higher
compliment to give to an erotic poet the name of the founder of
his style of poetry, than that of one who was not especially dis-
tinguished in this department, and who had devoted himself also
to so many branches of literature, prose as well as verse.

optivo=ad0ptivo, adscito Porph. The word is properly a
legal term: Gaius Ι. 154 vocamur antem lzz‘ qui nomz'mzlr'm testa-
mento tutores dantur, dalivi; qni ex optione sumuntur, optivz'.
Hence it means ‘any which he may choose’. Macleane is not
exact in rendering ‘desired'‚ nor is there any reason to suppose
this only a later use. The tutoris optio was sometimes given to
a woman by the will of her husband or father <Liv. XXXIX. 19. 5).
In the time of Claudius women above the age of puberty were
released from the guardianship of their agnates‚ which had been
ordained by the Twelve Tables, and allowed to choose their
own tutor (Gaius 1. 157) and in the Lex municipii Salpensae
(circ. A.D. 81) c. 22 the ius tutoris oplandz' is spoken of as'no new
thing. The word is much more likely to be an archaism.

crescit ‘ is glorified⁷.

103—105. So long as Ι am myself composing, and am a
candidate sor popularity‚ Ι have to put up with much : but as
soon as I return to my senses, Ι can stop my ears when poets
tecue, and sear no revenge on their part. Keller has a mark of
interrogation at auris, which is not so good.

Orelli argues that the rhythm of the verse requires us to take
inpune with legentibuS‚ understanding that the poetasters can
thenceforward recite without any sear of retaliation on the part
of Horace (as in Juv. Ι. 1—3). But the context requires us rather
to regard Horace as now able to do what he dared not do before.
