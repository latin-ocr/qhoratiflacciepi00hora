202 HORATJ EPJSTULAE.·

EPISTLE XVII.

This Epistle contains advice to a certain Scaeva, as to the
course which should be adopted to secure and to profit by the
favour of the great. Nothing is known or conjectured with
probability of the man to whom it was addressed. The scholiasts
say that his name was Lollius Scaeva, and that he was a Roman
knight. This notion is based upon the assumption that this
Epistle and the next are addressed to the same man, which is
demonstrably false. The cognomen Scaeva is found at this
period in use with the Junian and Cassian gentes, but there is no
evidence to connect Horace's friend with either of them. Nor
is there any indication of its date, unless indeed we may assume
that in writing v. 33 Horace had in his mind the triumph of
Augustus in B.C. ²9- But in any case the Epistle must have been
written after that date. Some critics have found grievous fault
with the tone which Horace here adopts. But it does not come
to much more than this, that a cynic's· life is not necessarily the
best, and that modesty is the best policy: no very degrading
doctrine, if not ideally elevated.

though I know you do not need it.

1. consulis. Ep. 1. 14, 6(n0te).

2. tandem: Horkel’s conjecture tenuem is very ingenious,
and has been actually adopted by Meineke: but· it is not neces-
sary.' No parallel seems to have been adduced for the use of
tandem in dependent questions: but there is no reason why it
should not be retained from the direct interrogation3 and
although it usually denotes some slight impatience on the partos
the speaker, this is often so slight as to be hardly perceptible.

3. docendus adhuc evidently goes with amiculus: it would

he quite superfluous, if referred to scaeva. The diminutive has
the force of ‘your humble friend'.

4. adspice, siquid: Roby§ 1754, S. G. ξ 748.

5. eureszvelis. For the perf. inf. cp. A. P. 98, Sat. 1. 2,
