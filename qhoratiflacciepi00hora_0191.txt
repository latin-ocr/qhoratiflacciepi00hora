Bk. 1. Ep. X.] NOTES. 155

allow us to reject it, with some good editors, as simply a gloss
on ftrtis5 and the rhythm, which would be decisive in Vergil,
carries far less weight in Horace. Cp. Cic. Ep. IX. 14. 1 te
summis laudibus ad caelum extulerunt.

rumore secundo ‘with loud applause’‚ lit. ‘with approving
cries'. The phrase seems to have been a poetical common-
place: Macrobius (Sat. vx. 1, 37) in illustration of Verg. Aen.
Vl11. 90 ergo iter inceplum peragunt rumore secundo quotes from
Sueius [of uncertain date] redeunt referunt rumore petita secztndo ,-
and Nonius (p. 444, 2) adds to the line from Vergil one from
Ennius (Annal. V11.) populi rumore secundo, and an example in
prose from Fenestella, a later contemporary of Livy. Cp. Cic.
de Div. 1. 16, ²93 Tac. Ann. 111. ²9·

10. liba ‘cakes⁷ made of flour and milk or oil (Athen. 111.
125 f. πλακοῦς ἐκ ’γάλακτος ἰτρίων τε καὶ μέλιτος ὃνῬωμαΐοι λίβον
καλοῦσι), and often spread with honey. Cato de R. Rust.
LXXV. directs that they should be made of pounded cheese‚ fine
flour, and an egg. For the placenta (which is here identical

‚with the libum) he gives much more elaborate directions in
c. LXXVI. Placenta is a curious instance of a Greek loan-word
(πλακόεντα ace.) transformed by popular etymology at an early
stage: ep. Hehn Kulturpssanzen³ p. 492, Mommsen 1. 2063 libum
is identical with our leaf. and has lost an initial c, as that has
lost an lc (A. S. lzlaeif); cp. Corssen Nachtr. p. 36. The-priest's
slave ran away, because he was tired of being sed on the
sacrificial calies.

11. pane egeo: Horace has the ablative also in Carm. 1. 22, 2 ;
but the genitive eight times: in sour other instances the word is
used absolutely. Cicero has the ablative frequently, the geni·
tive only in two doubtful instances (ad Att. VII. 22, 2 cp. 1100t3
ad Fam. IX. 3, 2); Plautus, Sallust, Livy (twice; but more
usually the ablative), and later writers have the genitive.

12—21. There z's no place better than tlze country for leading
a lise of simple conformity wz'llz nature.- tlze climate is so mild,
tlte lzerbage so fragrant, the water so pure.

12. convenienter naturae3 i. e. if we are to take the rule of
the Stoics as our gulde, which makes it the summum bonum
ὁμολογουμένως τῇ φύσει ζῆνι this Cicero (de Off. 111. 3, 13) ex-
plains to mean cum virtute congruere semper, cetera autem, quae
secundum naturam essent, ita legere, si ca virtuli non repug-
ἔιαίνὶςηί. But probably Horace used the phrase in a looser
as lon.

13. ponendaeque domo : it is apparently only the rarity of the
form domo for the dative—Neue Formenlehre 1. 520 quotes it
