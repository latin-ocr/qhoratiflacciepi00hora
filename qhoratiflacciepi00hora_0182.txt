146 ΗΘΚΛ Τ] EPISTULAE.

¹74. occultum=opertum in Ep. 1. 16, 51. piscis: the par-
ticle of comparison is omitted, and the metaphor is incorporated
with the main clause⁷ as osten: cp. Ep. Ι. 1, 2.

75. certus ‘regular', one who could be relied upon: Bent-
ley's suggestion of seras, as in Sat. II. 8, 33, ‘coming in at a
moment's notice to fill up a gap ‘, is quite needless.

76. rura, ‘ estates'‚ has the construction of ms: cp. Verg.
Aen. Ι. 2, Lavinaque venit litora.

indictis Latinis. The striae Latinae were not statae but
concaptivae, i.e. were held at a time fixed each year by the con-
suls, and proclaimed by a praeco. Until they had held this fes-
tival on the Alban Meum, the consuls were not allowed to
leave Rome (Liv. XXI. 63). The festival was made the occasion
sor a general holiday, and was always accompanied by a iusti-
tium, so that Philippus had no legal business to keep him in
the city. Mommsen Hist. 1. 41—42.

77. impositus mannis, not ‘on horseback’, in which ease
the plural (which some editors have explained as for uni ex
mannis) would barely be justitiable; but in the carriage drawn
by manni, as in Carm. 111. 27, 7. Orelli quotes Ov. Pont. 111.
4, 100 filius et iuncta, ut prius, ibit cquis, where however iunctis
determines the meaning of the phrase more clearly: as in Verg.
Aen. XII. 736 cnm prima in proelia iunctos conscendebat equos.
In Verg. Aen. lx. 777 (quoted by Lewis and Short for the use of
equi for a chariot) there is nothing to point to the singular force.
But cp. OV. Her. ΙΙ. 8ο inque capistratis tigribus alta sedet of the
car of Bacchus drawn by tigers. Homer has osten ἵπποι in this
sense, eg. 11. V. 13, τὼ μὲν ἀφ’ ἵπποιιν, 46 ἰ’ππων ἐπιβησόμενον,
X. 330 μὴ μὴν τοῖς ἵπποισιν ἀνὴρ ἐποχήσεται ἄλλος.

manni ‘were small Gallie horses [‘cobs'] famous for swist-
ness and evidently in great demand at Rome for use in harness.'
Munro on Lucret. 111. 1063 currit agens mannos ad villam praeci-
pitantes: cp. Ov. Am. Π. 16, 49 rapientibus esseda mannis ; but
they were also used for riding; cp. Auson. Ep. VIII. 7 vel cele-
rem mannum vel ruptum terga veredum conscendas, propere dum-⁷
modo iam venias, though apparently only in an emergency. I
cannot find the authority on which Forcellini (followed by Orelli)
defines a mannus as ⁴ animal ex equo et asina natum'.

Sabinum: the shortness of the holiday (six days) prevented
Philippus from visiting any of the sea-side retreats in Campania.
arvum caelumque, i.e. the fertility of the soil, and the pleasant
climate. Probably the praeco had rarely been able to leave
Rome3 for as a rule a Sabine farm was not much valued: cp.
Carm. ΙΙ. 18, 14 and Ellis on Catull. XLIV. 2.
