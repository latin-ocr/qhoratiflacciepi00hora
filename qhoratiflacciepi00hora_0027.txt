own blank verse, and with even greater possibilities
of varied music within its compass—had been shown
already both on Greek and on Latin soil. But it is
not too much to say that the full range of its capacity
would have remained unknown, if Horace had not
written his Epistles.

The textual 'criticism of the Epistles affords many
problems not easy of solution. There is no extant
MS. which holds an unquestioned place of paramount
authority, andwhich gives us a sure starting-point,
like the Ambrosian palimpsest (where it is legible)
for Plautus, or the Codex Bembinus for Terence.
The oldest MSS. are by no means so ancient or so

more importance‚ it is by normeans easy to deter-
mine their mutual relations, or to construet a table
of their various lines of descent from the archetype.

An attempt to divide thern into classes—the first
step towards a scientific treatment of their evidence-
