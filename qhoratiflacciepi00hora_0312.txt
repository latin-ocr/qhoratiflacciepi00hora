276 HORA TI EPISTULAE.

ephebus. The word is used by Cicero in its strict sense, de Nat.
D. 1. 28, 79 Athenis cum essem, e gregibus epheborum etc., but
not apparently by Plautus. There is an interesting account of
the Ephebi in Capes' University Life at Athens.- cp. Hermann,
Gr. Alt. 1. g 176.

172. attenti: Ep. 1. 7, 91.

173. Dossennus: Atellanarum sc7iptor, Comm. Cruq.
This is probably only a guesS, and an unlucky 0116 which has
misled many editors. The evidence for the existence of such
a writer is very slight and untrustworthy‚ and it seems quite
clear that Horace is speaking throughout of Plautus. Dossennus
was a standing character in the Atellan plays. Varro de Ling.
Lat. VII. 9 5 says: diclum mandier a mandendo, unde manducari,
α quo in Atellanis ad obsenurn vocant sllandztcum, where Miiller
corrects (Addend. p. 303) the corrupt words to Dossenum.
Ritschl (Parerg. Praef p. XIII.) at the suggestion of Bergk, on
the strength of this, interprets the present passage ‘ quantus ipse
scurra sit in scurris parasitis describendis ’‚ pointing out that
Horace here touches upon the four leading characters of the
fabula palliata, but censures Plautus especially for his treatment
of the fourth. Suetonius Galb.13‚after describing the niggardli·
ness of Galba, adds qume advenlus eius non perinde gratus
full: quue 2510).sz spectaculo appatuzt: siquzdem Atellanis
nolzssz'mmn canticum estz's Venit ione simus a villa, cuncti
simul spectato) es cousentzenle voce relzquanz par tem retulerunt
ac saeptus versu repetito egerunt. Here the corrupt words have
been corrected by Lachmann to Venit Dorsennus, though Roth
prefers to read with Casaubon, Onesimus, which is certainly much
nearer to the MSS. The point evidently lies in the avaricious
character ofthe man named, w hoever he may have been. Teuffel,
R0111.Lz'.tg9‚3 says ‘Dossennus (dorsum) is a cunning sharper,
the dottore' 1 do not know that there is any other basis for
this view than the conjecture as to the derivation of his name
Γ haud dubie a dorsi gibbere dicta ’ Ritschl)‚ the hump-backed
man being regarded as wisc, as we see frorn Aesop. From the
name lVlandmus it seems more probable that Dossennus was
a glut ton, ‘quae persona magnis malis et crepitantibus dentibus
insignis in pompa Circensium ludorum duci solebat' (Mtiller on
Varro, 1. c. ): and this 1s the view taken by Prof. Nettleship 111 a
paper read before the Oxford Philological Society. Ritschl
however prefers to regard the name as used here quite generally
for a buffoon without reference to the special features of the p.art
Festus, p. 364 M quotes from an Atellan play by Novius called
Duo Dassem'. Cp. Ribbeck, Fragtn. Com. p. 257 and 274.
Plin. N. H. XIV. .¹3' 92 says sed Fabius Dossennus lzzs versibus

the character, which he may have resembled, or played well (so
