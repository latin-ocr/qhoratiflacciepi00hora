BOOK ΙΙ.

EPISTLE I.

We have seen already from the First Book that the order in
which the Epistles were arranged for publication is not the
same as that os the dates of their composition. As in publish-
ing the first three books of the Odes, the Epodes‚ the first book
of the Satires, and the first book of the Epistles‚ Horace placed
at the beginning a poem addressed to his patron Maecenas, so he
may have wished to give the first place in this second book to an
Epistle addressed to Augustus, although this may not have been
the earliest to be written. We have therefore to look for other
indications of its date. Ritter thinks that he has found two
such. On the kalends of August in B.C. 12 an altar was
dedicated at Lugdunum to Augustus: cp. Suet. Claud. 11:
Claudius natus est.;.A'al. A ug. Luguduni, eo ipso die quo primum
ara ibi Augusto dedicata cst: Liv. Epir. CXXXVIII. ara dim·
Caesaris ad confluentem Araris et Rhodani dedicata: DioCass.
LIV. 32 προφάσει τῆς ἑορτῆς ἢν καὶ νῦν περὶ τὸν τοῦ Αὐγούστου
βωμὸν ἐν ΛουὙδούνῳ τελοῦσιε Strabo IV. 3, 2 τό τε ἱερὸν τὸ ἀνα-
δειχθέν ὑπὸ πάντων κοινῇ τῶν Γαλατῶν Καίσαρι τῷ Σεβαστῷ πρὸ
ταύτης ἵδρυται τῆς πόλεως [sc. Lugdunum] ἐπὶ τῇ συμβολῇ τῶν
ποταμῶν. To this altar Ritter finds a reference in v. 16. But the
language seems too general to be so limited in its reference. It
denotes a habit rather than a single act. In B.C. 19 an altar
to Fortuna Redux was decreed in honour of Augustus by the
Senate (Mon. Ancyr. c. 11): if any special reference is in-
tended, it is more likely that this is intended. But Sueto-
nius (Aug. c. LIX.) says provinciarum pleraeque super templa
et aras ludos quoque quinquennales paene oppidatim consti-
tuerunt; and although this refers doubtless mainly to a later
portion of his reign, the custom may have begun early. Hence
no conclusion can safely be drawn from the phrase in v. 16.

Another argument has been drawn from v. 255· Dio Cass.
(LIV. 36) tells how in the winter of B.C. 11—{0 the Senate
decreed that the temple of Janus should be closed3 but this
