NOTES. 417

oriental) Bellona: cp. Jnv. IV. ¹²3 ut flmatz'cus ocslw percussus,
Bellona, tuo divinat, with Mayor's note: here it is evidently
‘ lunacy’: sor iracunda. Diana is an explanatory addition, not, as
Schiitz thinks, a different kind of disorder. Acron here has
‘fcznatz'cnm errorem pati dicuntur, qui a sanis percutiuntur, id
est qui lymphatico agitantur. Sicut lunaticum aut morbosum.
ita insanum poetam tugiunt sapientes'. This use of the word
lunaticus is not common before the Vulgate. Diana, though not
strictly the same as Luna, was often identified with her, as by
Catull. xxxiv. 15, 16 tu potens trivia ct notho 'es dicta lumine
Luna: cp. Carm. lv. 6, 38.

455. vesanum: Ribbeck prints vaesanus in Vergil: but
there is not much authority for that form here.

456. agitant. ‘tease’t cp. Sat. 1. 3, 133 vellunt tihi barbam
lascivi pueri.

457. sublimis ‘with head in air’, nom. sing. A misunder-
standing has led to the reading sublimes in some MSS.

metatur, a rather coarse expression: but the word may have
undergone a change like that of ἐρεύγομαι in Hellenistic Greek:
cp. S. Matt. xiii. 55 ἐρεύξομαι κεκρυμμένα ἀπὸ καταβολῆς with
Carr’ s note, and Lobecl· on Phrynichus p. 63.

459. in puteum: cp. Ep. ΙΙ. 2, 133. The story of Thales
who fell into a well as he was looking up at the stars‚ is referred
to by Plato Theaet. 174 A.

longum‘ aloud', so that the sound goes sar; imitated from
Homer'saaxpdv ἅυσεν, Il.111. 81.

460. non sit, not imperative, as Kriiger and others (cp. Sat.
11. 5, 91 mm etiam sileas), which 1s inconsistent with the context;
nor yet ‘coniunctivus pro futuro positus’ as Hand says, but the
hypothetical subjunctive, rather loosely used after decidit. tollere:

cp. Ep. Ι. 17, 61 ,

461. sl curet: most MSS. have sic, a good instance of the
carelessness which is osten found towards the end os a work.
The editions before Bentley had sor the most part sz' quis curet
against the MSS. Bentley corrected, calling attention to the
practice of Horace, when a word is repeated, not to allow the
accent to sall in the same place3 tollere niret, si curdt quis.
Keightley has collected a number of instances from Greek and
Latin, and from various modern languages‚ in a note on Milton's
Lycidas v. 165 weep πό 7120re‚w0ficl sheplzel ds w p no mAr,e·

demittere is of course the right form, but most MSS. have
