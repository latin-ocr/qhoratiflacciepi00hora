Bk. Ι. Ep. XL] NOTES. 163

ΙΙ. 23, 36. Dean Alford had inscribed on his tomb DEVER-
SORIUM VIATORIS HIEROSOLYMAM PROFICISCENTIS.

13. frig-us collegit, ‘ has got thoroughly chilled’: cp. Verg.
Georg. 111. 327 ulai sitim collegerit hora .· so in Ov. Met. v. 446
the inferior MSS. have sitim collegerat, though there the better
have conceperat. It is more common to find smgrus contrahere.

furnos, used in Sat. 1. 4, 37 as a place *of public resort,
though not, as the dictionaries based on Freund have it, as ‘a
war1ning-place'3 apparently the furni were public bake-houses
(Juv. V11. 4), and Horace means to say that when a man has got
very cold‚ he will go anywhere where he can be well warmed,
without meaning to stay there.

17—21. ,Τ lze plear-ure resorts of the E ast da not snit one wlco

17. Incolumi facit [id] quod, ‘is to a healthy man what!
Editors generally quote as parallel the use of facere with the
dative for ‘to suit‘, as in Prop. IV. (111) 1, 20 non saciet capiti
dura corona meo, or more commonly with ad, as in Ov. Am. 1.
2, 16 frena minus sentit quisquis ad armasacit, Her. VI. 128
flledeae faciunt aa' scelus omne manns. But in this construction
an object is never expressed or (as here) implied.

18. paenula,' a rough woollen or leather cloak worn in
rainy weather: cp. Juv. V. 79 cum. . .mull0 stillaret paenula nimbo,
with Mayor’s note. The Greek form φαινόλης is perhaps only an
attempt at assimilation from the better-established φελόνης : cp.
Tisch. and W. H. on 2 Tim. iv. 13. Nothing is known of the
derivation of the word in either language.

campestre, i. q. sublzfflzcuhcm, a light apron, originally worn
under the toga in the place of the tunic, a custom retained by
candidates for office, and by some old-fashioned people (cp. on
A. P. 50), but more commonly retained only as the sole garment
worn in the exercises of the Campus. Lewis and Short are mis-
leading in supposing it to have been generally worn in hot
weather in place of the tunic. Cp. Marquardt Ra'm. Prz'valalt.
11. ¹59 with the references there.

19. Tiberis, in summer it was customary to bathe in the
Tiber ι Carm. 111. 12, 6, Sat. 11. 1, 8.

caminus [whence our chimney, Fr. chdnzz'nc'e, through cami-
nata] a fixed ‘ stove', as compared with the moveable foculus or
brazier. Chimneys do not appear to have been common in
South Italy, and few have been found at Pompeii except in baths
and bake-houses, but in Rome and in Northern Italy they were
doubtless frequently in use. Cp. Overbeck Pompeii, p. 340, and
hence correct Becker Gallus, 11. 269.
