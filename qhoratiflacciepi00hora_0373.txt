pictonbus...potestas: the objection of a critic (sulykctio),
as Acron says, or as Prof. Nettlcship prefers to regard it, another
dictum quoted from the Greek, to which Horace supplies the
necessary qualification.

10. aequa: Acron interprets this as ‘equal’. The connexion
then is: ‘poets have just as much liccnce of unrestricted imagina-
tion as painters have: but we have scen that there are limits in
the one case; therefore there must be also in the other’. Orelli
and Schtitz reject this interpretation, preferring to translate
‘reasonable’‚ as in aequum ius etc. But ‘a reasonable power of
unlimited licence’ is a contradiction in terms, not to be defended
by saying that quidlibet is an intentional exaggeration, corrected
m the next line.

11. petimus quasi poetae, damus quasi critici. Acron.

12. coeant: cp. Ep. 1. 5, 25 ut coeat par iungaturque
pert.

13. geminentur ‘are paired’.

14. :inceptis = ‘ plans '-

15. purpureus ‘brilliant': sor the wide sense in which this
word is used cp. the commentators on Carm. 111. 15, 15, lv. 1,
ιο or Verg. Aen. VI. 641. Orelli thinks there is a reference to
the lalus clavus which bordered the loga praetexta, or to the
flounce (instita), sometimes attached to the stola. This hardly
suits the context: the panni are not attached as appen'dages
to the body of the work, but incorporated here and there
in it.

16. lucus οὗ ara. This and the following instances are
probably taken from contemporary poets, but we cannot identify
any of them.

18. Rhenum, an adjective, as Carm. lv. 4, 38 llletaurum
flumen .· Tac. Hist. IV. 12 mare Oceanum.

19. nunc ‘at the moment '.

erat, from the point of view of the reader, who goes back to
the time of writing the poem.

cupressum. The scholiasts tell a story of a bad painter,
who could paint nothing but a cypress. A shipwrecked man
requested him to paint a picture of his disaster, that he might,
according to the cust0m‚ carry it about, and get alms (Juv. xxv.
301 mersa rate naufi‘agus assem dum rogat el picta se tempestate
tuetur). The painter asked if he did not want a cypress intro-
duced ; which gave rise to a Greek proverb μή τι καὶ κυπαρίσσου
θῖλειςς applied to one who wishes to introduce ornaments out of
p ace.
