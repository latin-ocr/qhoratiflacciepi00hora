82. Aesopus especially distinguished sor tragedy; Roscius
equally eminent in both; hence gravis=‘impressive ’, doetus
‘skilsul'. Cic. often speaks of both: cp. de Orat. 1. 28, 129,
30; 61, ‘2583 pro Sest. 57, 1213 58, 123. etc. The former of
these great actors was living in 13.C. 55, the latter died in B.C.

Tragbdie‚ pp. 671—675.

least Cruq. has that form here and on A. P. 161 quotes the vet.
Bland. as his authority sor imlu’rbus. Hence most good editors
have adopted it here, though Keller prefers imberbes, found in all
his MSS. Lucil. 977 (Lachm.) has imberbi androgyni. Cp.
Neue, formenl. ΙΙ. 88.

perdenda: the only instance in classica] Latin of afim'le
passive form from perdo is in Sat. 11. 6, 59, but perditus of

86. 1am=iam vera, ‘in sact’. Saliare carmen: the chants

to the priests themselves by the time of Quintilian (1. 6, 40
Saliorum carmina vix sacerdotibus suis satis intellecta): for the

usus, i.q. populus, dnm utitur. ⁴ To be read and thumbed by
the public, as they severally enjoy it'.

93. positis bellis. At what date was this? It is evident
that Horace is thinking mainly of Athens, and doubtless the
great outburst os Athenian art and literature followed upon the
close of the Persian lVars: cp. Aristot. Pol. v. 6, p. 1341 ‘As
