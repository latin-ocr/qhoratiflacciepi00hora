EPISTLE VIII.

This Epistle was written in Β. C. 20, and is addressed to the
Celsus Albinovanus who is mentioned in Ep. 1. 3, 15 as one
of the suite accompanying Tiberius in his expedition to Armenia.
It may possibly have been sent at the same time as Ep. 111.
The tone is curiously self-reproachful; it is not likely to have
been adopted by Horace simply in order to relieve his own
feelings: such a view would be inconsistent with the relations
which seem to have existed between Horace and Celsus, who
was probably young enough to have been his son. It is more
likely assumed to prepare sor, and at the same time to sosten, the
kindly warning to a friend whose pride in his advancement at
court seemed to require a check.

1—12. Bear my greelz'ngs, llluse, to Celsus; and iflzc asks os
me, tell lzz'm tlzat l am but z'll content witlz my own temper, slotlz
andfickleness.

1. gaudere et bene rem gerere, ‘ greeting and good wishes '
Ξχαίρειν καὶ εὖ marran: cp. Plaut. Trin. 772—3 salutem ei
nuntiet verbis patris: illum bene gerere rem et valere et vivere.
Perhaps there is here a reference also to his duties as secretary
(scriba): ‘ wishes for his success in his new office ⁷. Albinovano:
an instance of an agnomen added to a cognomen, as in the
case of the poet Pedo Albinovanus.- the origin of the name is
obscure; Ritter suggests Albium Intimalium (now Ventimiglia)
in Liguria as a possible place of origin. The name was borne
by a P. Tullius sixty years before this in the civil wars (Appian,
Α B.C. 1. 62), and by a M. Tullius contemporary with Cicero
(ad Quint. Fr. 11. 3, 5).

2. rogata, sc. a me ‘ at my request'. refer ‘bear ', as
osten with mandata etc„ where re has the meaning not os
‘back ’‚ but of execution of a duty; cp. the similar use of ἀπο-
δίδωμι; there is no reason to suppose this letter an answer to one
from Celsus. comitl: Mommsen (Hermes, IV. p. 122) argues that
comes is used here merely as ‘companion on a journey’, not tech-
nically, as in Ep. 1. 3, 6. In v. 14 cohorti denotes the suite.

3. quid agam: cp. Ov. Trist. 1. 1, 17 sz' quis quid agam
forte requirat erit, vivere me dices, salvum tamen esse negabis.

multa et pulchra minantem, ‘in spite of many fine pro-
mises', not limited to literary work, but extending to the
conduct ot'life generally. For the phrase see Sat. 11. 3, 9.
