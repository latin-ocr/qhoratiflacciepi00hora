os coire et volnus sanescere: cp. Ov. Trist. 1v. 4, 41 Neve retrac-
tando nondum coezmtz'a rumpam vulnera.

32. rescinditur, Petron. 113 credo veritus, ne inter initia
coeuntis gratiae cicatricem rescinderet. Cic. Lael. 21, 76 amicitiae
sunt dissuendae magis quam dz'scz'ndmdae. ac, much better than
at, which Orelli reads, putting ? at rescinditur. The translation
is ‘You must write me word of this too, whether you make as
much of Munatius as you should. Or does your mutual regard,
like autin-sewu wound, join to no purpose, and break open
again, and does some cause—be it your hot blood, or your
ignorance of the world—chase you, wild as you are with your
untamed necks?’ This, one would think, is sufficiently ⁴ regular
and natural '.

33. rerum inscitia is ‘ignorance of the world’ in general,
rather than ‘ misunderstanding of the facts' in any particular
instance, as Orelli takes it. Cp. de Orat. 1. 22, 99 (note);
Caes. B. G. Ι. 44 mm se tam imperilmn esse rerum ut non
sciret. Nagelsbach Stil. p. 59.

35. indigni—rumpere. Cp. A. P. 231, Roby ἕ 1361, S. G.
540 (2) ⁴ ’twere shame to break the ties, which made you once
sworn brethren and allies' Conington.

36. in vestrum reditum, evidently, from your Eastern carn-
paign, cp. Carm. 1. 36. Some absurdly take it of their recon-
ciliation ⁵ reditum in gratiam ’.

EPISTLE IV.

Albius Tibullus the poet was ten or twelve years younger
than Horace3 he died shortly after Vergil (B.C. 19) when still
iuvenis (Epigr. Dom. Mars. in Baehrens’ Tibullus p. 88), a
term which is just, but only just, reconcileable with the sup-
position (Cruttwell Rom. Lit. p. 299) that he was born about
the same time as Horace (13.C. 65), but which points more
naturally to a later date, indicated still more plainly by the
obiit adolescens os the life in Baehrens, l.c. Ovid (Trist. ΙΙ. 463)
tells us that he was known as a poet only after Augustus became
princeps, i.e. aster B.C. 28. His ancestral estate at Pedum
(between Tibur and Praeneste in Latium) had been reduced
from what it once had been (cp. El. Ι. ι, 19—20)‚ perhaps in
consequence of the confiscations of B.C. 42, though of this there
is no positive evic'ence. He speaks of himself as poor, an ex-
pression which, in view of line 7 of this epistle, may be ex-
plained either by poetic modesty, or by the hypothesis of a
subsequent addition to his property by the favour of Messala,
his patron. The tone of the two (genuine) extant books of his
