and the Istrian wars.

8—9. forum—severis. Cp. Catull. V. 2 rumoresque senum
severiorum. The question into whose mouth Horace puts these
words depends upon the reading in v. 10. The old reading
edixit has been again defended by Schiitz, who argues that
Liber is to be taken as the subject. ‘The knowledge of Roman
conditions cannot surprise us in a God, especially as he is in-
troduced under his Latin na1ne; and to lay stress upon the
anachronism destroys the jesting tone of the passage'. But
even if we allow this, the whole context shows that Horace is
ridiculing his own slavish imitators, not the poets who fell in
with the ordinance of their patron deity. Bentley rightly saw that
pallerem in v. 18 made this quite clear. The attempts that have
been made to find a subject in Cratinus or Ennius are still less
successful. The puteal Libonis—a low circular wall built round
a spot in the forum, which had been struck by lightning.
between the Temple of Castor and that of Vesta (ep. Marucchi
Descrz'zsone del Foro Romano Roma 1883 p. 65), by Scribonius
Libo, possibly the aedile os13.C. 193, but more probably the trib. pl.
of 13.C. 149—was certainly not known to Cratinus, and probably
not to Ennius. Hence it is much better to accept the reading
edixi, which has good MS. authority. The word is used with a
certain mock solemnity ‘I laid down this law’, as in Sat. ΙΙ. 2, 5¹ ;
3, 227, with a reference to the praetor's edict. Perhaps it is
better with Bentley to suppose that Horace had expressed this
opinion ‘inter convictores' than to press passages like Carm. 1.
18, 3; 111. 35 and Ep. 1. 5, 16—20, the last of which, at any rate,
would hardly be-in general circulation by this time.

The Scholiasts here and on Sat. ΙΙ. 6, 35 tell us that the
praetor’s tribunal was set up at the puteal Libonis: but ΜΓ Pahner
rightly points out that in neither of these passages, nor yet in
Pers. lv. 49 (where cp. Conington's note) is there any reference
to legal business. Itis better to take it simply as ‘the Exchange',
where business rnen, and especially money-lenders meet. Cp.
Cic. pro Sest. 8, 18 alter.. puteali et j'oeneralormn gregibus
inflatus. The question whether there were not two or even
more puteals in the Forum is one not easy to decide : cp. Dict.
Biogr. 11. 780 A (where there is an engraving of a coin with a
representation of the p. Libonis): Burn’s lx'ome and the Cam-
pagna p. 86: Nichol’s Roman Forum p. 129. If however the
Scholiasts here and on Pers. 1V. 49 are right in saying that the
p. Libonis was near the Fabian arch, it can hardly have been
identical with the puteal of Attus Navius in the Comitium (Cic.
de Div. 1. 17, 33: Liv. 1. 36: Dionys. 111. 71) where his famous
