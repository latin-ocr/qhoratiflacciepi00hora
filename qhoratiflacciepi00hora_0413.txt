crevere: according to the current story the harp had but
sour strings at first, and this number was increased to seven by
Terpander (flor. uc. 670—640), and to ten (or eleven, cp. Dirt.
Biog. 111. 1148l1) by Timotheus (fl. 420—380): cp. Miiller's
Greek Lz't. 11. 76. But the· first part of this statement seems very
doubtful: Bergk Gr. Lit. 11. 122, 211, Mahafsy Gr. Lil. 1. 168.

by Verg. Aen. xl. 383 tona eloquia, Iuv. Χ. 114, and in later
prose.-The abruptness of the transition from the music to the
diction of the chorus, led Ribbeck to consider this and the follow-
ing line spurious: but it is not out of place to note the change in
language as well.

219. sortilegis: divination by sortes, strictly speaking, was
not practised at Delphi, although it was at Dodona (cp. Cic. de
Div. Ι. 34, 76), and, especially in Italy at Praeneste and Antium:
cp. Mommsen, Hist. 1. 187 n.: but the term was commonly ex-
tended to any utterance of an oracle, as in Verg. Aen. lv. 346
Lyciae sortes, Ov. Met. 111. 130 Phoebeis sortibus, Cic. de Div. 11.
56, 115, where the word sors is used of the answer sent from
Delphi to Croesus.

non discrepuit Delphis, with a compressed eomparison, sor

Latin, either by such compression or by the repetition of the
substantive. Cp. Cic. de Orat. 1. 4, 15 (note), Mayor on Iuv. ff,
111. 74, Holden on Cic. de Off. 1. 22, 76. ll

srorn τράγος ‘a he-goat’, because this was the prize offered sor
success init, is now abandoned by the best authorities, who derive
the word rather stom the goat-like appearance of the chorus,
who were dressed as satyrs (cp. Bergk Gr. Lz't. 111. 12-13‚
Donaldson T healre of tlze Greeks-⁷ p. 65), it was that generally
adopted by the ancients; and there is no doubt as to the fact
that a goat was regularly offered in sacrifice to Bacchus (cp.
Verg. Georg. 11. 380), and that this goat was assigned as the
prize to the leader of the victorious chorus.
