might speak of a ‘good name' on a bill. Cp. Cic. ad Fam. v.
6, 2 ut bonum nomen existimer ‚· ad Att. v. ἰι uam aut bono
nomine centesimis contentus cram aut non bono quaternas cen-
tesimas sperabat: in Verr. v. 7. 1 7 clamare ille... pecuniam sila· csse
in nominibus ; numeratam [cash] in praesentia non habere. Trans-
late ‘to lend out money secured by good names'.

106. maiores audire goes with per quae. etc. by a slight
zeugma, as well as minori dicere: ‘to leam from elders and to
teach a junior the means by which’‚ διε.

107. damnosa, cp. Ep. Ι. 18. 21 danmosa Venus. The reser—
ence is here only to the injury which sels-indulgence may cause
to one's fortune.

108. calet ‘is fired’: Orelli quotes Lucian's description of
the people of Abdera (de conscr. hist. 1) as seized with a sever
(ίὲἕέἑτΙ-ιιὲἒ for tragedy. Cp. Juv. vll. 52 insanabile scribendi

109. puerique: so Cruquius read, without however quoting
his authority. Horace never makes the first syllable in patres
long except in arsis: Vergil always has patres preceded by que,
except in Aen. V11. 176 perpetuis soliti patres consalere mensis,
where the long vowel occurs in thesis. Keller objects that there
is a certain climax in patres he1·e; but the expression is more
sorcible if we take it as ‘young and old alike'.

110. troade comas vincti. The garlands‚ which were
almost a necessary item sor the comissatio aster dinner, were
made of flowers, especially violets and roses, and leaves, such as
ivy, myrtle‚ and parsley, were only used when flowers could not
be procured (cp. earm. 1. 4, 9; 36, 153 38, 5; 11. 7, 255 lv.
11, 3), or when simplicity was desired: but here the diuers
assume the poet's bays. Cp. Becker Gallus³ 111. 315—324.

dietant ‘ dictate’, the verses being composed ex tempore, and
the poet desiring that every word should be taken down by the
guests. Cp. Sat. 1. 4, 10.

111. nullos versus: cp. Ep. 1. 1, 10. The reference is of
course only to lyric verse.

112. Parthis mendacior: if there was any truth in the
charge implied in this comparison, the Parthians must have de-
generated much from the Persians: αἴσχιστον ’γὰρ αὐτοῖσι τὸ ψεύ-
δεσθαι νενόμισται (Herod. 1. 138): παιδεύουσι δὲ τοὺς παῖδας τρία
μοῦνα, ἱππεύειν καὶ τοξεύειν καὶ ἀληθίζεσθαι (ib. 136). Porphyrion
here says ‘ bene Parthis, qui perfidi sunt, et qui Romanos duces
fraudibus saepe deceperunt'‚ and Acron refers especially to their
attacks upon Crassus. Certainly the death of Crassus himself
