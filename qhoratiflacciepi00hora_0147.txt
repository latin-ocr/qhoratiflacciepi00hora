19. cornicula. Horace departs from the familiar Aesopian
fable (Babr. 72, Phaedr. 1. 3) in two ways, by substituting a crow
sor agraculus ‘jackdaw '‚ or possibly ‘jay ', and by representing
the seathers as dropped by various birds, each one of whom
comes to reclairn his own. Strictly speaking, corvus is the
generic name, including all the various species from the raven
(corvus corax) and the carrion crow (corvus corone) down to the
jaekdaw (corvus monedula), while cornix is the took, or (in
modern zoology) the hooded crow (corvus cornix). But the
words are often used loosely (cp. Keightley Notes on Vergil, Exc.
VI.)‚ and perhaps Horace means by cornicula (which is only used
here) the jackdaw.. Graculus Aesopi was proverbial (Tert. adv.
Val.12); and Lucian Apol. 4 says εἰ λέ-γο ιέν σε τὸν κολοιὸν
ἀλλοτρίοις πτέροις α’γάλλεσθαι. The comparison and the main
thought are blended into one. asin Ep. 1. 1, 2; 2, 42: we may
