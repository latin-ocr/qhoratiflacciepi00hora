mean simply ‘to enact⁷, so latae sanctiones, etc. The dictionaries
do not treat this usage satisfactorily, and fail to recognise its
extension. Here lata is connected properly with lex, and by
zeugma with poena: we may translate ⁴ enacted’.

154. describi: cp. Sat. Ι. 4, 3 si quis erat dignus· describi,
quod malus ac fur, quod moechus fhret. So osten in Cicero for

gepjcting tShe bad features in a character: cp. Reid's note on pro
u α 29, 2.

vertere modum ‘changed their tone '. Ritter assumes that
there is here a definite reference to the substitution after the
decemviral legislation of more innocent jesting, such as the
Atellane plays and the exodia, for the earlier political lampoons.
But there is no reason to believe that Horace is speaking with
historica] accuracy: the various stages, which Livy (V11. 2)
sketches, were all long after the time of the decemvirs. The
supervision of the authorities over public literary efforts seems
to have been severe and continuous (cp. Mommsen Hist. 1.
474), and the result not simply what Horace here describes
(ib. ΙΙ. 432 ‘the restrictions thus stringently and laboriously

ξηροῗῑεξζ by custom and police on Roman poetry stifled its very
reat .

155. bene, opposed to male, of the moral tone, not the
artistic quality os the writing.

156. Graecia capta, again a certain historica] laxity. Greece
cannot be said to have been subdued before the capture of
Corinth in B.C. 146: but Greek literature was familiar to the
educated at Rome, and the Greek dramas brought upon the
stage in the form of translations and adaptations more than hals
a century earlier by Naevius, Ennius, and Plautus. It is very
doubtful whether we can, with Ritter, force the phrase into
harmony with history by understanding Graecia to denote the
Greek cities in Italy and Sicily. Horace is doubtless looking
rather at the general fact that Greece though conquered in arms
proved victorious in letters than at the precise chronological
sequence.

158. numerus Saturnius: its general character is well de-
scribed by Macaulay in the Introduction to his Lays of Ancimt
Rome. The fullest recent discussion, with a collection of all
extant Saturnian verses, is that by L. Havet De Saturnio Lati-
norum Versu (Paris, 1880, pp. 517). The metre appears to
have been used very rarely aster the time of Naevius. There are
however some rude instances in sepulchral inscriptions, e.g.
C. Ι. R. 34. Hermann, Ep. Doctr. Aletr. p. 214 thinks that
they were used by Varro in his Satires, but this is very doubtful.
The typical instance is Dabu‘nt mallim fllete'llz' 1 Nadvio'podtae:
