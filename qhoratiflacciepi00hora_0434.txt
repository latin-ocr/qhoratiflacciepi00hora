with a few others have an, and their authority iz enough to make

us accept it, as it is at least as good: Roby ἓ 2255, S. G. ἓ 888.
Macleane seems to think it a conjecture of Bentley's.

aerugo used in Sat. 1. 4, 101 of the canker of malice, here
denotes the canker of avarice. Properly it is the rust upon
copper coin. In Apul. Met. 1. 21 aerugini semper intenlus it
seems to be used as a contemptuous expression for money, but

that is not a sufficient reason why we should take it so here, as
Hildebrand (ad loc.) contends.

331. speramus has more authority than speremus; as Bentley
says ‘utrumque probum est, ut nescias utrum utri praeferendum
sit ’. So Cicero osten has censemus and arbitramur.

332—365 (quid deceat, quid non). A poet must be brief, not
extravaganz‘, ami neillzer empty nor loo severe. Some slzps may

hepardmzed; anda poem must be judged as a whole ,· and witlc
regard lo z'ts general style.

332. cedro, the resinous exudation of the cedrus or juniper-
tree, was used to preserve books from decay: it was smeared on
the unwritten side of the roll: cp. Vitruv. 11. 9, 13 ex cedro
oleum, quod cedrium dicitur, nascitur, quo reliquae res unctae, uti
etiam libri, a tineis ct α carie uon laeduntur. OV. Trist. 111. 1,
13 quod neque snm cedro flavus nec pumice levis. Hence Pers.
1. 42 has cedro digna locutus. cupresso: cp. Schol. Cruq. ‘cu-
pressus autem est cedri species7 unde confici solent capsulae, in
quibus reponebantur scripta poetarum contra tineas.’ The lines
333—4 may be from the Greek: the comment then will be
vv· 335—365·

335. brevis: Horace is himself one of the first masters of
the terse speech that sticks.

336. dociles and fideles are predicates and may be translated
best by adverbs.

337. omne...manat·: Bentley suspected this to be a line
soisted in by the monks‚ like many single hexameters in Juvenal.
His suspicions are groundless here.

339. ne is the reading of most MSS. restored by Bentley for
nec: it is here final, not imperative. velit has the support of
the better MSS. and I do not see why we should not retain it:
many of the best editors prefer volet.

340. Lamiae. According to a Libyan legend Lamia was a
beautiful queen beloved by Zeus, but bereft of all her children
by Hera, whereupon she retired into a lonely cavern in the midst
of wild rocks, and there became a treacherous and greedy
monster devouring the children of others from spite: cp.
