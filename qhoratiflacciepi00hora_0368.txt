332 Ales POETJCA.

ing years, as e.g. in Ep. 11. 2, 55 f. ⁶ There is nothing of the air
of a man who is weary and feels that his work is done‘ (Nettle-
ship). It is true that in v. 306 he says that he is now writing
nothing himself3 but this expression may be referred just as
well to that period of inactivity which followed the publication
of Odes 1.-—111., and to which Horace refers in Ep. Ι. 1, as to
that which marked the latest years of his life.

(6) The metrical structure of the Epistola ad Pisones has
been carefully examined by Haupt and Michaelis, without lead-
ing to any very definite conclusion. But in some points it stands
midway between the First and the Second Book of the Epistles.

(7) Prof. Nettleship has remarked that the Rhine (v. 18)
would not be a welcome theme for poets or their patron after
the defeat of Lollius on its banks in B.C. 16. (Tac. Ann. Ι. 10.)
On the other hand we must not forget the brilliant campaigns ot
Drusus in B.C. 12, 1 1, and 9.

(8) The arguments for the traditional date drawn from v. 63sf.
break down upon a more correct interpretation of that passage,
sor which see notes in loc.

(9) Itis noteworthy that there is no trace of intimacy with
Augustus in this epistle. His name is not even mentioned. Now
Horace was probably in very close relations with the emperor
after his return to Rome from the East in B.C. 19.

All indications therefore agree in pointing to a time not sar
removed from the date of the First Book of the Epistles, i.e.
about B.C. 20, as the date for the composition of the Epistola
ad Pisones. But this date is quite incompatible with the identi-
fication of the Pisos given by Porphyrion. It only remains
then that we should regard this as an unlucky guess of the
scholiast‚ or rather of the unknown authority on whom he drew ;
and see what other Pisos are available. The name was a very
common one in Rome at this time, and no little care is required
in reading Cicero or Tacitus to keep its various bearers distinct.
But one of the most eminent was Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the
consul of B. C. ²3· He had fought against Caesar in Africa, and
had afterwards joined Brutus and Cassius· After the amnesty
which followed the battle of Philippi, he had kept aloof from
public life, until Augustus urged him to accept the consulship.
He was probably some ten or twelve years older than Horace.
His eldest son Gnaeus was consul in Β. C. 7 and must therefore
have been born not later than ἐξ. c. εἷο. But another fact enables
us to determine the date of ‘liis'birtli more precisely. At his
death in A. D. 20 he could appeal to Tiberius per quinque et
quadraginta annorum obsequium, whence it appears that he
must have entered upon public life not later than Β. C. 26.
We must therefore place his birth in B. C. 44, so that at the
death of Quinctilius he was in his twentieth year. This Piso
plays an important part in the earlier years of the reign of
