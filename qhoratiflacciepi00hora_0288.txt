252 ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE.

In Ep. 1. 2, 16 which Orelli adduces to defend the MS.
reading, extra is just as much a preposition as intra .· and
similarly in Liv. XXXI. ²4 intra eam (portam) extraque. Schiitz
says that intra oleam conveys the just meaning, whereas extra
nucem would mean not ‘on the outside of the nut ’ but ‘apart
from it' and that therefore the construction was necessarily ,
changed. Ι think Bentley’s emendation a great improvement.
The sense is: if we are to be led astray by comparing things which
though alike in some respects differ in others, like Greek and
Roman literature, then we may as well argue that an olive has
no stone because a nut has none, or a nut no shell because an
olive has not. We may go on to say that there is nothing lacking
to our perfect success, even in painting, in music, or in athletics.

32. fortunae: Schiitz (after Lehrs) objects to this word;
and says that it was a very poor compliment to Augustus for
Horace to regard it as absurd to suppose that the Romans had
reached the height of fortune under him. He suggests culturae,
though in good Latin this word never has the meaning which
would be required here of the result of cultivation, but only the
process (cp. Ep. 1. 1, 40). Ribbeck despairs of the line, unless
he is allowed to transpose it to after 107. 1 do not see any fatal
objection to the traditional interpretation, as above, though cer-
tainly the logie is neither clear nor good. Porphyrion oddly
takes it of poetry‚ ‘sed hoc intellegi quam a se dici maluit.’

pingimus: the four main branches of a liberal education
among the Greeks were γράμματα, γυμναστική, μουσική and (as
some added) γραφική. Literature is here omitted, perhaps be-
cause the superiority of contemporary Greeks was not so clear
in this as in the other three. Painting, music and athletics were
alike despised by the Romans until the days of the Empire.

34—49. lt is quite impossible to draw any fixed line between
llze old and tlze new.

34. vina: Pindar praises old wine ancl new poems (Ol. tx.
48 αἴνει δέ παλαιὸν μὲν οἶνον, ἄνθεα δ’ ὕμνων νεωτέρων).

(1351 quotus: the answer would have been expressed by an
or ma .

adroget: we might be content with the meaning ‘elaims’
here and in A. P. 122, while that is clearly the force of the word
in Sat. 11. 4, 353 but in Carm. xv. 14, 40 that rendering is less
satisfactory: fortuna...0ptalmn peractis imperiis decus adrogavz't.
Mr Page there suggests a possible connexion with the force of
pror-ogo ‘grant in extension'‚ so that adrogo would be ‘grant in
addition' just as abrego means ‘to take away' originally by a
proposal addressed to the people, so adrogo may mean simply to
‘add to’. Orelli⁷s notion that the meaning here is derived from
the formal adrogatio or adoption in the comitia is not probable.
