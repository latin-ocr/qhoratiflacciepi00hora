sor his great scheme of conquest (Mommsen, Rijm. Aliinzw.
p. 5²)· Five of them were equal to the mina (cp. Plaut. Rud.
13¹4): the average weight of those extant is 8·6 grammes
(Hultzsch‚ alell-aloga, p. 242-3). If estimated by the present
value of the amount os gold they contain‚ their value is about
ΑΙ. 35. 6d.: but if measured by their relation to the drachma
(2ο times 9312), the value is nearly identical with that of the
French napolc'mz or twenty—franc piece, i.e. about 165. 3d. The
relation of silver to gold was generally taken as 1 to 10, though
we find it varying between this proportion and 1 to 1373,st now it
is normally Ξ to 15} (Cp. Hultzsch, Metrologic‘2‚ p. 240, and
Tabell.XV1.

235. notam labemque ‘mark and blot'. remittunt ‘pro-
duce': Sat. ιι. 4, 69: δ, 53.

236. atramenta. includes writing-ink, painter's black, black—
ing sor boots, and in short all kinds of dark fluids.

239. edicto: cp. Plin. N. H. v11. 37, 12 5 idem lzic imperator
edixit, ne quis ipsum alius qnam Apelles pingeret, quam Pyrgo-
teles sculperet, quam Lysippus ex aere duceret. But as there
were representations of the king by other artists we can only
understand this to mean either that Alexander gave commissions
himself to no others, or that he never sat to any one else. Cp.
Overbeck, Griecln'sclze Plastiffl, 11. 01.

Apellen: cp. Ep. Ι. 2, 12 (note). Apelles painted Alexander
as bearing the thunderbolt (Plutarch, Alex. 4).

240. Lysipp02'sor the case cp. Ep. 1. 16, 2ο (note). The
advance in statuary made by Lysippus is thus described by Pliny
XXXIV. 8, 19 plurimum traditur contulisse capillum caprimenda,
capita minora faciendo, quam antiqui, corpora graciliora sicciora-
que, per quae proceritas signorum maior videretur. He limited
himself to bronze casting, and never worked in marble.
Propert. IV. (111) 9, 9 says gloria Lysippi est animosa effingere
signa.

duceret: Bentley defends the conjecture os Lambinus cu-
deret, arguing that ducere cannot be applied to the metal itself‚
but only, as iu Pliny l. c. and elsewhere. to that which is formed
ont of the metal. But cudere would be an improper term to
use of work which was cast, not hammered. The extension os
the usage of ducere seems quite legitimate, and may be defended
(with Schiitz) by phrases like ducere filum sor ducerefilo carmen .-
in Ep. 1. 6, 17 aera is used sor signa ex aeresacta.

242. subtile ‘exact’: Pliny (H. N. xxxv. 10, 85) gives a
very different account of Alexander's critical faculty: Alexandro
