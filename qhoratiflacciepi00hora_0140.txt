44. argentum ‘money' as in Sat. 1. 1, 86, 11. 6, 103 Ep. 1.

ungenti ratio comparet tamen), Juvenal and late prose, but not
found in good prose. A more common meaning is that ol

is used for πλούσιος in Homer. pueris creandis ‘to bear chil-
dren’. We are told by Gellius (IV. 3) that Sp. Carvilius divorced
a wise to whom he was warmly attached, because she bore him
no children, regarding this as a religious duty quod iurare acenso-
ribus coactus erat, uxorem se liberum quaerundum gratia habi-

as if a rich wife were needed to bear offspring.

45. pacantur ‘are brought into subjection’ like barbarous
lands, subdued by the Roman arms ε cp. Ov. Ep. Pont. Ι. 2, 109

result produced: a misunderstanding os this force has led to the
reading contzg-it is in the Bland. vet„ inserted however per
lituram: sor qualifications of the statement sometimes made
that contingit is only used of good things cp. Cic. in Cat. Ι. 7, 16
