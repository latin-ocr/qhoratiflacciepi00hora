the name being akiu to mens—came to stand sor them by mct-
onymy, as Ceres sor corn, Bacchus sor wine, and Juppiter sor
the sky (if this be the true explanation of the usage). Cp. Sat.

388. nonumque...1n annum. It can hardly be doubted
that (as Philargyrius on Verg. Ecl. lx. 35 says) there is a direct
reference to the Smyrna of C. Helvius Cinna: cp. Catuli. xcv.
1—2 Smyrna mei Cinnae nonam post denique messem qnam
coepta est nonamque edita post hiemem.- Quint. X. 4, 4 Cinnae
Smyrnam novem annis accepimusfdctam. In his case the long
elaboration seems to have led to obscurity3 but Vergil greatly
admired him (Ecl. lx. 35). Cp. Teuffel Rom. Lit. ἓ 210, 2-3.
But Horace seems to refer not so much to the time spent upon
the composition, as to the interval to be allowed to lapse be-
tween its completion and publication, and so Quintilian takes it
in his dedicatory letter to Tryphon: quibus componendis...paulo
plus quam biennium...impendi .·...71sus deinde Horati consilio,

389. membranis ‘the parchments'. Usually membrana
denotes the parchment case or wrapping of the papyrus roll,
which formed the liber: cp. Ellis on Catuli. XXII. 7, with Munro
on Catullus p. 53 (quoted on Ep. 1. 13, 6); but that meaning is
out of the question here. Schiitz thinks that this passage proves
that parchment was sometimes used for the rough draft ofa poem:
but this is unlikely in itself, as parchment was very expensive,
and besides it spoils the point, which comes out better if we
suppose that, even aster the sair copy had been made, the poem
