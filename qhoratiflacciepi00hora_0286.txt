mens, ille tuus etc.‚ decides to read lzoc on very slight authority,
joining in lzoc uno: but then, as Ribbeck has shown, the next
line becomes quite superfluous, for unztm is sufficiently explained

by 15—17. It is possible however that uno is masc., taken with
le.

21. suis temporibus ‘the measure of lise assigned to them '.

The epithet which would more properly belong to the authors
is transferred to their works.

23. veterum, neuter, not masculine, as is shown by cetera,
semota and defuncta. Cp. Tac. Ann. 11. 88 vetera extollimus

recentium incuriosi. tabulam, the laws of the Twelve Tables,
carried by the decemvirs.

25. aequata ‘made on equal terms', a probably unexampled
force of the word, which leads Mr Reid to conjecture that we
should read aequa icla; but the transference of meaning is hardly
too bold for Horace: to Gabiis we must supply cum from the
following clause. Dionysius Halic. (1V. 58) says that he saw in
the temple of Ζεὺς πίστιος on the Quirinal a treaty made by Tar-
quinius Superbus with Gabii, written on the hide of the ox slain
at the ratification of the treaty. Cp. Niebuhr Hz'st. 1. 512. For
treaties with the Sabines cp. ib. pp. 231,-561.

26. pontificum libros, properly the books containing the
laws of ritual and worship (Cic. de Orat. 1. 43, 193, Macrob.
Sat. Ι. 12, 21), but probably including also the annales pon·
tificzmz or annales maximi. Cp. Cic. de Orat. 11. 12, 52

(note), where Cicero speaks of the entire absence of ornament
in their style. Cp. Teuffel, Rom. Lz‘t. ἐξ 63, 66.

volumina vatum: ‘ veteres libros Marcii vatis aut Sibyllae':
the oracles of the Sibyl were written in Greek3 but there were
current at Rome certain Carmina Alsarciana in Saturnian verse,
ascribed to a prophetie Marcius (as Livy XXV. 12, and Pliny
H. N. VII. 33 say), or to two brothers of the name according
to Cic. de Div. Ι. 40, 89, which soretold the defeat of Cannae,
and enjoined games in honour of Apollo. The date of these is
unknown, but cp. Weissenborn on Livy l.c.

27. Albano in monte: ‘quia Egeria nympha dicebatur
loqui cum Numa Pompilio in Albano monte' Acron. This legend
does not appear elsewhere in quite the same form3 but Ritter
labours hard to show that it is equivalent to that which places
the grove of Egeria at Aricia, which was not indeed on, but at
the foot of the Alban mount. Cp: Ov. Met. XV. 487, Servius
on Verg. Aen. V11. 763 eductum Egeriae lucis. Ov. Fast. 111.
261—2. He is however clearly wrong in supposing this grove
at Aricia to be that mentioned in Juv. 111. 17, which was
close to the Capene gate at Rome, sixteen miles away. Burn
