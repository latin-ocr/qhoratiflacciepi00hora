rendering

The wretched Moor, who matched himself in wit
With keen Timagenes, in sunder split

is based upon the story given by Acron. ‘cum Timagenem
philosophum post convivium et inter pocula declamantem vellet
imitari et non posset, invidia quodammodo discerptus est’,
though he seems rightly to reject the notion that rufat means
simply rupit i''.nvzdta Any notion of envious rivalry seems out
of keeping with the next line.

Iarbitam: the Scholiasts tell us that this man was a Mau-
retamim, named Cordus—possibly the same as the Codrus of
Verg. Ecl. VII. ‘26 invidia rumpantur ut ilia Codro—who was
nicknamed Iarbitas from Iarbas, the king of the Gaetulians who
appears in the Aeneid (IV. 196). Timagenes was a rhetorician
of Alexandria, who was brought as a prisoner to Rome by
A. Gabinius in ΒΕ. 55, and was at first employed as a cook‚ and
a litter-hemer, but was afterwards ransomed by Faustus Sulla.
He opened a school of rhetoric, and met with much success,
acquiring the favour of Angustus. But afterwards he offended
the emperor by some bitter jests upon his wife and family, and
was compelled to retire to the estate of Asinius Pollio at
Tusculum.

17. vitiis with imitabile, not, as Schiitz says, with decipit,
which can well stand alone. Cp. Juv. XIV. 40 quoniam dociles
imitandis turpibus ac pravis omnes sumus. In the context hc
refers to Brutus and Cato.

18. pallerem can only mean ‘if Ι were pale’ which I arn
not. Conington’s ‘should my colour fail’ is rather misleading.
Horace describes himself as sun-burnt in Ep. Ι. 20, 24.

exsangue cuminum: cp. Plin. H. N. xx. 14, 57: omne
(cuminum) pallorem bibentibus gignit. Ita certe strunt Porcii
Latronis clari inter magistros dicendi assectatores similitudinem
coloris studiis contracti imitatos. Persius as usual imitates
Horace in his pallentis grana cumini (V. 56). Exsanguis does
not appear to be used again in this sense of ‘causing paleness'
before Claudian (in Ruf. 11. 130 exsanguis Rufinum perculit
l101‘r07'); but Persius Prol. 4 has pallidam Pirenen in the same
sense: and so Propert. V. [1V.] 7, 36 cnm insidiis pallida vina bibi.
The practice of drinking vinegar to make the sace look pale and
interesting has not been unknown in later days.

19. servum: ‘hoc novum et fortius quam servile’, Ritter.
Ovid has serva manus (Fast. VI. 558) and serva aqna (Am. 1. 6,
