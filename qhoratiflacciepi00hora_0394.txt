353 ΑΕΒ POETJCA.

Eteocles in the Sept. Theb. and the Phoenissae. Of the stupidity
commonly ascribed to them (Ep. 11. 1, 244) there is, I think, no
trace in tragedy. Argis (Ep. 11. 2, 128110te): the Argives are
contrasted with the Thebans. probably because of the prominence
of the legends, dealing with the struggle between them, in the
tragic cycle. If Agamemnon is the typical Argive, the character
is one of proud dignity.

119. aut...finge. This line would perhaps be more in place
after 124 : sor fama. ‘the current tradition’ refers more naturally
to the plot of the play, which is dealt with in 125-135‚ than to
the character of each individual.

120. scriptor ‘ when writing'‚ not a vocative, as many
editors, including Bentley, prefer to take it. It is almost neces-
sary to define reponis.

honoratum : this use of the word for ‘illustrious’ [cp. Ep. 1.
1, 107 note] is so rare, and seems so otiose in itself here, that
Bentley boldly replaced it by [loma-eum.- and this has been
accepted by some of the best modern editors. But it is a
form found nowhere else, hence L. Miiller prefers Bentley's
alternative Ilemeriacnm, which is supported by the analogy
of Hellespontiacas, Tarlcssiacns, etc. The adjective in prose
is Homeritas, and this, as Schtitz shows, is only used where
there is a reference to a particular passage in Homer: e. g.
Cic. de Leg. 1. 1, φ, Homericus Ulixes Deli se proceram ct
teneram palmam vidisse dixit, i.e. ‘Ulysses in Homer (Od.
VI. 162) said that he had seen’, etc. The epithet honora-
tum may be best defended, by bringing out its full meaning:
‘ when in the receipt of his due honours’ ε where he complains
that he is ἀτίμητος as in Il. Ι. 644, or is lamenting over Patroclus,
the epithets of v. 121 are less suitable to him. Still in Cic. de
Leg. 1. 1 1, 32 it is used simply as contrasted with inglorius. For
Cic. Orat. 9, 32 see Sandys ad loc. [Ι think Horace may have
written inoratam in the sense of inexorabilem: cp. Prop. V· 11, 4
non exorato stant aziamanle viae. J. S. R.]

maddened husband, carrying with her her two sons Learchus and
Melicertes. Athamas seized the former and tore him to pieces ε
Ino flung herself into the sea with the latter, and they were
changed, the mother into the sea-goddess Leucothea, the son into
Palaemon. Cp. Ovid Met. 1V. 416*-541 : Hom. Od. V. 333 ff.
The woes of Ino (Ἰνοῦς ἄχη) became proverbial, and ‘she was
