y. 236, and Sat. 11. 1, 60 vitae color. We must say ‘style’ or
tone’.
88. pudens prave ‘ from a false shame '.

90. privatis, i.e. suited to daily lise: a shocking tragedy in
the life of a king ought not to be described in verse suited to
the ordinary affairs of a simple citizen.

91. cena. Thyestae: the story of Thyestes, tricked by his
brother Atreus into eating the flesh of his own two sons, is told
by Aeschylus Agam. 1517—-1536 (cp. Soph. Aj. 1294), and was
made the subject of a tragedy by Varius, the friend of Horace,
which according to Quintilian X. 1, 98 cuilibet Graecarum com-
parari potest. coena is a barbarism: Fleckeisen, Funfizgr Artikel
10.

92. This line has been transposed to after v. 98 by L. Miiller,
and rejected by Lehrs and Ribbeck. Certainly it rather breaks
the connexion of the thought, and could well be spared, but it
may be defended as a generalising remark introduced by Horace,
to bear out what he said in v. 86: quaeque then refers not to
tragedy and comedy, which is hardly possible grammatically
(though oecasionally quisque Is used where uterque would be
more correct), but to all kinds of poetry. decentem is the reading
of the Bland. vet. and the excellent Berne MS. restored by
Bentley, and adopted by the best editors since. The construction
then is singula selum quaeque locum teneant, (quoniam) sortita
(sunt locum) decentem. Schiitz and Keller defend decenter, con·

necting it with teneant.
93. et comoedia. ‘even comedy'‚ as well as tragedy.

94. Chremes, a name borne by old men in the Andria,
Phormio, Hautontimorumeuus of Terence, and by a young man
in the Eunuchus. The reference here is probably to the severe
language of Chremes in Haut. V. 4. Horace uses the word of
a miser in Epod. Ι. 33, borrowing it froin some unknown
comedy. Perhaps the name was applied to old men from a
belief' m the absurd old etymology‘ a χρέμπτεσθαι semare, quia
senes screare solent ². It is really connected with χρεμ-ίζω ‘to
snort', and grim etc. (Fick, lVrh.3 Ι. 582, Curt. Gr. El. Ι. 250J:
the Chremes of the Eunuchus is an ‘ adulescens rusticus ’.

95. plerumque ‘often ' as in v. 14. tragicus ‘in a tragedy’‚
