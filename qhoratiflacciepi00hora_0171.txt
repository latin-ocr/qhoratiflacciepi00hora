why the lists of the czz 'cs szne stsffi·‹z‹ ιο were called the laheltla
Caeritum. Gellius XVI.13 ass-ests that the inhabitants of
Caere were rnade ῃιηηῑίῐρω stne susti-'agn' τ’·ἰιη because they
took charge of the Roman sacra at the time of the Gallie
invasion (cp. Liv. V. 40): and that the name was afterwards
applied versa vice to those whom the censors degraded and
deprived os their votes. There is some reason to suppose that
what was originally a mark of honour sor the Caerites became
a badge of int'eriority‚ after they had been defeated in an attempt
to throw off their connexion with Rome (cp. Madvig, op. cit.

p. 46).

EPISTLE VII.

The date of this Epistle has been given by Ritter as the
autumn of ΒΕ. 21. He argues frorn Ep. 1. 2, 2 that Horace
was at this time at Praeneste, within view of the Alban hills
(v. 10), and was intending to go down to Velia or Salernum
for the winter (Ep. 1. 15). In this year also Augustus left
Sicily for the East, and sent. Agrippa (now married to Julia)
to take charge of home affair53 hence Maecenas was relieved of
his more important public duties, and would have been all the
more at leisure to enjoy the society of Horace, so that he com-
plained of his absence. But there are too many conjectural

links in this chain of argummssle us fo ειοῖἔρξῖἳῖῐῖῦι
