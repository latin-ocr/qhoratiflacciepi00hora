368 ARS POETJCA.

ἡμέρᾳ, διὰ τὸ τοῦ ἀπόντος εἶναι τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν καὶ οὗ δὲ ἐνδεεῖς,
τούτου μάλιστα ἐπιθυμοῦσι. Hence the meaning is ‘eager for
longer life '. Cp. Soph. Frag. Acris. 64 D τοῦ ζῆν ’γάρ οὐδεὶς
ὡς ὁ ’γηράσκων ἐρᾷ. So Acron rightly explains it. But again we
must confess that the expression is unparalleled, and hardly in
keeping with Horace's frequent use offuturum elsewhere.

173. dlfficffis ‘ cross-grained ’, Sat. ΙΙ. 5, 90 dffcilertz et moro-
sum.

querulus: Ar. Rhet. 11. 13, 15 ὅθεν ὀδυρτικοί εἰσιν καὶ οὐκ
εὐτράπελοι οὐδὲ φιλο-γέλοιοι.

1λιιᾱαῒιο1· temporis acti: ib. §12 διατελοῦσι ’γάρ τὰ ’γενόμενα
λέγοντες· ἀναμιμνησκόμενοι ’γὰρ ἥδονται. Like Nestor in Homer.

174. minorum: Ep. Π. 1, 84.

175. multa...adimunt: ‘anni venire dicuntur ad quadra-
gesimum sextum usque annum, inde abz'reiam accedente senecta'.
Cornm. Cruq. This phrase, like that in Sophocles, from which
it was possibly borrowed (Trach. 547 ὁρῶ ’γὰρ ἥβην τὴν μὲν
ἕρπουσαν πρόσω, τὴν δέ φθίνουσαν), ‘supposes an ἀκμή, a definite
point to which lise ascends and from which it descends’: cp.
&Vickhain’s note on Carm. 11. 5, 14, a passage which, as he
justly points out, is not really parallel. The French say Un
ltomme sur son relonr. Cp. 'l‘ennyson's Miller's Dauglzter:

There’s somewhat flows to us in lise,
But more is taken quite away.

Schiitz prefers a second explanation given by Acron, according
to which all years that lie before us are called venientes, and
those which are past are recedentes. The old man has few years
before him, and therefore cannot expect so many commoda as the
young man. Conington renders

Years as they Come, bring blessings in their train:
Years as they g0, take blessings back again.

Ι This is ambiguous, but points in the direction of Schiitz's
view.

176. ne forte, etc, Y ou must remember this, lest you should
assign the characters wrongly. Schiitz connects this with mora-
bimur, not with adimunt: and certainly the connexion of thought

with v. 178 is closer than with v. 175. For the rhyme cp. v. 99
note.

178. aevo goes with adiunctis as well as with aptis. The
adiuncta are according to Acron quae bene haereant et congruant
aelati.·=attributes‚ τὰ καθ’ αὐτὰ συμβεβηκότα, or ‘necessary
accidents’. Cp. Mill⁷s Logia· Ι. 7, ξ 8, and Cic. Acad. 1. 5, 21
quae heatae vilae adiuncta smel, ‘things inseparable from a
