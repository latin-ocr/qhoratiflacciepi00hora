xxviii JNTRODUCTJON.

On the other hand Keller and Holder place these
MSS. along with B in the interpolated class, and
consequently rate them comparatively low. Keller's
arguments are set forth in his Epilegomena, pp. 800
——803: they have been replied to by Dillenburger,
Mewes and most fully by Hoehn in a dissertation
published at Jena in 1883 (pp. 55). The conclusion,
to which a careful consideration of the readings of V
in the Epistles has brought me, is given more than
once in the notes, and is identical with that which
Professor Palmer expresses in the Preface to his
edition of the Satires (p. xxxi): ‘1 am disposed to
regard this famous codex as an interpolated descend-
ant of a better archetype than that from which the
Horatian MSS. are descended.' At the same time,
it seems to be evident that its antiquity was over-
stated by Cruquius, and that, as it was written in
minuscules, it could not have been earlier than the
tenth century.

With regard to the Epistles Hoehn's conclusion
is that in Book Ι. out of 117 recorded readings, 80
are certainly right, 19 wrong, 18 doubtful: in Book II.
of 38, 22 are right, 5 wrong, 11 doubtful, in the Ars
poetica of 32, 23 are right, 1 wrong, 8 doubtful.
These figures may be on some points open to ques-
tion3 in particular, some of the readings noted as
doubtful are either almost certainly right, or point to
the true reading. But the general result is to show
how much better V stands such a test than any
