134 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

comitia erely formal: cf. Tac. Ann. 1. 15, and Merivale Hist.
c. XLIV. α znzt.

54. curule ebur, sc. the sella curulis, a distinction enjoyed

by the curule aediles, praemrs, and consuls. inportunus, ‘ruth-
lessly’: cp. Cic. in Cat. IV. 6, 12 (note).

55. facetuszblande et comiter, ‘ politely'‚ apparently a col-
loquial usage ι cp. Ter. Heaut. 521 mulier comnmda, faceta haec
meretrix. adopta: Spartianus says of the emperor Didius
Julianus (c. 4) senatum el equestrem ordinem in palatium veni-
entem admisit, atque unumquemque, ut erat aclas, vel patrem vel
fillum vel parentem affizlus blandissime est.

56—64. If good dinirgr is good living, then be off to tlte
mark-et betimes, lo secure ils choicest daz'nlies, and take Gm‘gz'lins
fhr your model.

56. lucet, ‘day has dawned ⁷, i.e. it is time to be off in
quest of dainties.

57. piscemur‚ venemur. ‘ Let us go off for fish and game ἐ

more usual; and therefore very confidently read campum for
populum. But the repetition may be defended by the emphasis
laid upon the presence of the people as spectators: and the
use of dg'ffi'rtum by a zeugma, like that in Ep. ΙΙ. 1, ¹59 lex

was not much frequented till the afternoon. And even in the
contracted forms the similarity between campum and populum
is not great enough to make the conjecture probable.

60. unus...e multis, ‘one of all the train’‚ as in Verg. Aen.
v. 644, not here in the proverbial sense, found eg. in Sat. 1. 9, 71,
Cic. Tuse. Ι. 9, 17 (K'uhner), ἃς.

61. crudUS, properly ‘raw’ (connected with cruor, κρέας,
etc. Vanicek p. 174), is applied alike to undigested food, and
