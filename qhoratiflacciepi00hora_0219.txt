water treatment (Suet. Oct. Lxxxx) and by a free use of lettuces
(Plin. N. H. XIX. 8, 38). He now recommended the former to
Horace, who therefore had no need to resort to the vapour baths
over the sulphur springs at Baiae.

tamen, although it is Musa’s fault, not mine.

4. gelida: Plin. H. N. XXIX. 1, 5 mentions a certain Charmis
of Massilia, who frigida etiam hibernis algoribus lavari persuasit.
Mersit aegros in lacus. Videbamus senes consulares usque in
ostentationem rigentes. ’

eum: ‘now that'.

5. murteta: Celsus 111. 27 siccus calor est ct arenae calidae,
et laconici, et clibani, et quarundam naturalium sudationum ubi
a terra profusus calidus vapor aedificio includitur, sicut super
Baias in murtetis habemus. Vitruv. 11. 6 also describes the
buildings erected over the natural jets os sulphurous vapour·

6. cessantem ‘chronic’‚ lingering3 nervis: apparently these

vapour baths were especially efficamous in cases of muscular
rheumatism-

elldere ‘to drive out', a technical medical term t cf. Cels. ΙΙ. 1 5
gestatio utz'lim'ma est...eis quibus lentae morborum reliquiae
remanent, neque aliter eliduntur. Baiae is represented as

bearing a grudge against invalids who have courage to follow
Musa's severe regime.

8. caput: Celsus recommends the douche for strengthening
the head and stomach ε 1. 4 capiti m'lzz'l aeque prodest atque aqua
smgida: itaque is, cui hoc iifirmum est, per aestatem id bene largo
canali quotidie debet aliquamdiu subicere: 1V. 5 qui stomachi
resolutione laborant, his perfundi smgrida, atque in eadem natare,
canalibus-*eiusdem subicere etiam stomachum ipsunt...consistere in
frigidis medicatzsquefhntibus...salutare est.

9. clusinis ε at Clusium itself there do not appear tohavebeen
any springsof note3 and the place itself was unhealthy, because
of the miasma arising from the marshes produced by the over-
flowing of the Clanis (Tac. Ann. 1. 79), until these were drained
by the grand-dukes of the house of Lorraine. At S. Casciano de
Bagni, about twelve miles to the south of Clusium, there are
baths of ancient date, and it has been suggested (Dennis Cities
qutruria 11. p. ²9¹) that Horace may have been referring to
these. There is no important town nearer to these than
Clusium. But perhaps Horace's language does not require any-
thing more than the ordinary springs, not wanting in the hilly
country round Clusium itself. It has been suggested that the
baths (mentioned by Tibull. 111. 5, 1 vos tenet Etruscis manat
quae sontibus unda, unda sub aestivum non adeunda canem) may
