leaves is suggested as much as the loss of old ones. 1t is doubt-
ful however whether solz'is can mean by itself ‘by the growth of
new leaves’. even with the antithesis of prima cadunt: the pas-
sages quoted by Vahlen (on Aristot. Poetik2 p. 88) by no means
suffice to establish this. A niediaeval commentary paraphrases
prima, scilicet, fidia, cadunt, nova succrescunt, ita vetus aetas
verborum, id est, verba z‘n vetere aetate inventa intereunt, et modo
nata...st0rent. Hence Prof. Nettleship (Journal qf Plzilology,
XII. 51) suggests that the line originally ran prima cadunt, nova
suem-escun! ; velus interit aetas: the words ita verborum having
been originally a gloss upon aetas: and this he finds confirmed
by a passage in Jerome which runs (cum) alia venerit generatio
primisque cadenlz'bus foliis virens silva succreverit. Lehrs had
already suggested the loss of a line after v. 60 in which succrescunt
occurred. The only difficulty as to accepting Nettleship's inge-
nious suggestion is the doubt whether verborum can be spared.
—The metaphor is doubtless suggested by Homer, ΙΙ. VI. 146—9

has found many other echoes in literature.

Sive receptus etc. The western coast of Italy was very
deficient in good harbours (though not so bad as the eastern, but
cp. Cic. de Orat. 111. 19, 09). Hence at the time when Sextus
Pompeius was threatening Rome with a strong fleet, Agrippa,
the adiniral of Augustus, found it necessary to construet an arti-
ficial port. On the coast of Campania, between Misenum and
Puteoli, there were two small lakes, the Avernus and the Lucri-
nus, separated from each other by a strip of land about a mile in
breadth, while the latter, the outer lake, was divided from the
sea by a narrow belt of sand or shingle. It seems that the sea
occasionally broke through this, and that Julius Caesar accord-
ingly had it strengthened, in order that the fish-preserves os the
Lucrine lake might not be disturbed. Agrippa now further
strengthened this barrier by sacing it with stone, but pierced it
with a channel to admit ships, and also connected the two lakes
by a canal, so as to form a sase and capacious harbonr, called
the Portus Julius. Vergil (Georg. 11. 101—164) speaks of this
work as one of the glories of Italy. But though the Lacus
Avernus was of great depth, the Lucrinus was but a shallow
lagoon; so that the operation was not permanently successful,
and even in the time of Strabo the harbour was practically aban·
doned. ⁷ Merivale (111. 261) seems to be in error in ascribing its
abandonment to the construction of a harbour at the mouth of
the Tiber by Octavius3 sor the porlus Augusti near Ostia,
