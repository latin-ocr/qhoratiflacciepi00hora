Bk. 1. Ep. xv] NOTES. 187

30. saevus fingere: similar infinitives after adjectives, called
prolative or complementary infin. by Kenncdy and Wickham,
occur in Ep. 1. 1, 14; 2, 643 7, 57; 16, 12; 17, 473 A. P. 163,
165, 2043 in the Satires in 1. 4, 8, ης 11. 3. 3¹33 7, 85; 8, 24;
and no less than 24 times in the Odes. They form a marked
feature in the style of Horace.

31. pernicies...mace111 ‘the ruin. and storm and abyss of the
market’‚ because he burst down upon it, carrying havoc with
him, and swept off everything into his insatiable maw. Cp. Plaut.
Capt. 903, 911. For the barathrum at Athens see Dr Hager in
Journ. Phil. V111. 12. The word is used somewhat differently
in Sat. 11. 3, 166, but cp. Plaut. Cure. 122 age ecfzma'e lzoc [vinum]
cito in barathrum. macellum seems to have denoted originally
a slaughter-house, thence a meat-market‚ but it came to be
applied to a market sor all kinds of provisions ι cp. Varro L. L.
v. 147, Donatus on Ter. Eun. 255, Curt. Gr. Etym. 1. 407.

32. donabat will stand very well as the main verb of the
sentence. Bentley's conjecture donare! leaves Maenius without
any proper construction3 and the reading donarat of the vet.
Bland. and other important MSS. on which it is based seems
only an assimilation to quaesierat.

33. nequitiae ‘his wicked wit ’-

35. vilis is evidently needed with agninae more than with
omasi [like ‘tripe’ a Keltic word] which was always a cheap
coarse food5 there are many instances in the Satires of et in the
second place in its clause: eg. 1. 3, 543 6, 113 10, 71 etc.
Plautus (Capt. 816) complains of the butchers who sold lamb
dear: apparently he expected it to be cheap. It is nowhere
mentioned as a dainty.

36. lamna, contracted for lamina [better spelt lammz'na]‚
as in Carm. 11. 2, 2. Torture by the application of red-hot
plates of metal is often mentioned, eg. in Plaut. As. 543 ad·
versum stetimus lamminas crucesque compedesque, nervas, catenas,
carcerem, numellas, pedicas, baias, im pactoresque acerrumas gnaros-
que nostri tergi: Lucret. 111. 1017, verbera, carnfices, robur, pix,
lammina, taedae, Cic. in Verr. V. 63, 163 cum zgnes ardentesque
lamminae ceterique cruciatus admovebantur.

ut diceret: the man’s coarse gluttony is humorously re-
presedntffgstgas entitling him to censure severely epicures, and
pen .

nepotum, Epod. 1, 34: Sat. 1. 4, 49 (nepos filius); 8, 1r;
Sat. 11. 1, 533 3, 225; Ep. 11. 2, 193. The word is also common
in Cicero in this sense, but not apparently elsewhere.
