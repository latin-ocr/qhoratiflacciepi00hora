392 ARS POETJCA.

would rather keep my sanity as va critic, and teaclz others, with-
out attemplc'ng verse myself.

296. excludit sanos: cp. Cic. de Div. Ι. 37, 80 negat sine
surore Democritus quemqnam peelafn marrnum esse posse, quod
ulem di'czt l'lato (sc. Phaedr. 245 A ὃς δ’ ἂν α’νευ μανίας Μουσῶν
ἐπὶ ποιητικὰς θύρας ἀφίκηται, πεισθεὶις· ὡς αρα ἐκ τέχνης ἱκανὸς
ποιητὴς ἐσόμενος, ἀτελὴς αὑτός τε καὶ ἦ ποίησις ὑπὸ τῆς τῶν μαινο-
μένων η του σωφρονοῦντος ἠφανίσθη; cp. Thompson' s note): and
similarly' m de Orat. Π. 46, 194 (see note there). According to
Diog. Laert. IX. 7, 48 Democritus wrote a book on poetry, in
which something like Plato’s words may have been found. Cp.

Cic. pro Arch. 8, 18 accepimus..poetam...q2msz· divino quodam
spiritu inflariff) Sat. ΙΙ. 7, 117.

297. bona pars, just like our ‘a good part’, ‘a good many’:
so in Carm. IV. 2, 46 meae vocis bona pars, Sat. Ι. 1, 61 bona
pars hominnm: Lucret. V. 1025 has bona magnaque pars ; so
Ter. Eun. 123: Cicero has it in his dialogues (de Orat. 11. 3, 14)
not in his speeches. It strikes one as a somewhat colloquial
usage: hence the phrase in the Odes may not be really parallel,
though VVrckham takes it so. non unguis ponere, i.e. neglects
personal appearance, cp. Ep. 1. 7, 50 (note). Schiitz quotes
'Fatian’s description of the Cynics (adv. Graecos, p. 87) κόμην
ἐπιειμένοι πωγωνοτροφοῦσιν ὄνυχας θηρίων περιφέροντες.

298. barbam, properly the mark of a philosopher (Sat. 11.
3, 35 sapienlem pascere barbam), but allowed to grow by all who
were careless of their appearance. The public baths were great
centres for social reunion.

299. nanciscetur: the indefinite subject ‘a man’ is supplied
rather awkwardly aster hona pars: hence Ribbeck suggests to
read qui sor sz', a good conjecture, if any was needed.

300. Anticyris: hellebore grew abundantly at Anticyra in
Phocis, a town on a small peninsula, to the east of the Crisaean
Gulf. It was not far removed from Cirrha, but Ι doubt the con-
nexion between the names which Prof. Palmer assumes (on Sat.
11. 3, 82). Many persons carne to reside there for medical treat-
ment (ib. 166). There was another Anticyra on the Spercheius
at the head of the Maliac Gulf, and it is asserted (but only on
the late authority of Stephanus) that hellebore grew there too,
and that the natives professed to have cured Heracles of his
madness. An attempt has been made (sanctioned even in the
Dict. Geogr. and in Kiepert’s maps) to discover a third Anticyra
to suit this passage by straining an expression in Livy XXVI. 26,
in which Anticyra is said to be in Locris: but even the text
there is doubtful, and the words brevis navigatio a Naupacto est
are interpreted by the immediately subsequent addition that the
town was attacked on the third day. Strabo’s language too by
