266 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

was due to a treacherous abuse of the forms of negotiation (Meri-
vale 11. 23). But charges of saithlessness have been always
brought against a dreaded enemy with or without reason from
the time of the petfiditzplus quam Punica which Livy ascribes to
Hannibal (XXI. 4, 9) to Napoleon's perfide Albion. Cp. infidi
Persae in Carm. IV. 15, ²3· This passage must have been writ-
ten aster 13.C. 17 when Horace returned sor a while to lyric
poetry.

prius orto sole, not like the old Romans, to give ad-
vice to their clients‚ but to begin composing. This is not neces-
sarily inconsistent with ad quarlam iaceo of Sat. Ι. 6, 122, sor
there he is not represented as sleeping, but as reading and writ-
ing in his lectulus.

114. habrotonum ‘southernwood’ or ‘ Pontic wormwood’
(Munro on Lucr. lV. 125), is mentioned elsewhere as a usesul
medicine. Plin. XXI. 92, 160 usus elsoliis [habrotoni]‚ sed maior
semim ad excalsaczendum, ideo nereis utile, tussi, orthopnoeae,
convulsis, ruptis, lumbis, urinae angustiis.

115. quod. medicorum est. Bentley not unnaturally found
fault with the tautology involved in the mention ofphysicians‚ after
qui didicit dare: and suggested melicorum— melici. Eut the pas-
sages which he quotes do not suffice to show that melicus can be
used as equivalent to musicus.- in Lucret. V. 33⁴ organici melicos
peperere sonores the word means merely ‘tuneful', and in Plin.
vu. 24, 89 a Simonide melico it means ‘a lyric poet’, not a
musician. It would be better to allow the repetition to stand,
than to remove it by such an uncertain conjecture. But, as Prof-
Palmer has pointed out to me, medici is often used in the sense
of ‘surgeons⁷ rather than ‘physicians’‚ e.g. Plaut. Men. 885,

117. indocti doctique ¹ unskilled and skilled auke’: doctus
like σοφός is a common epithet of a poet: cp. Carm. 1. 1, 29
with VVickham's note.

119. sic collige: Sat. ΙΙ. 1, 51 sic collige mecum. avarus:
so Ovid A. A. 111. 541 nec nos ambitio nec amor nos tangit lza-
bendi. Pope's imitation is

‘ And rarely Av’rice taints the tunesul mind '.
