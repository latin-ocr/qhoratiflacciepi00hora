280 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

petorrita ‘ waggons ’, four-wheeled carriages, used especially,
according to Acron and Porphyrion here, sor slaves. Cp. Palmer
on Sat. I. 6, 106. Essedum and petorritum are probably both
Keltic words, but cp. F est. p. 206 petoritum et Gallicum velli-
culum csse, cl nomen eins dictum esse existimant a numero 1111
rotarum: alii Osce, quod hi quoqne petora quattuor vocant.

naves, either the rostra of captured ships, or perhaps even
ships themselves, drawn in a triumphal procession by means of
machinery. We have no detailed description of a lrz'umplzus
navalis (cp. Liv. XXXVII. 60, XLII. 20, XLV. 42), but the coins
struck by Q. Fabius in commemoration of his triumph sor a
victory at sea bear the image of a quadriga with Jupiter in it,
and under the horses a ship's beak. Cf. Marquardt, Ram.
Staalsv. ii. 570·

193. ebur, i. e. statues of ivory and gold: Livy speaks of
tusks carried in procession in the triumph over Antiochus (XXXVII.
59 tulitin triumpho...el›umeos dentes M CCXXX] ) but these
would not be suited for a display on the stage.

Corinthus, not restricted to vessels of Corinthiam bronze,
as Acron seems to imply, though doubtless including these, but
all the spoils of Corinth, and also probably a painting of the
city. So Porphyrion : ⁴ quia imagines eius oppidi fabricantur, ut
in triumphali pompa transire possint'. Cp. Cic. in Pis. 25, 60
quid laudan habet isle currus? quid vincti ande currum duces? ‘
qnid simulacra oppidormn ? quid aurum ,9 quid argentum?
T ibull. II. 5, 115 ut llbssallinmn [clebrem cum praemia belli
ante suos currus oppida vl'clafcret. Liv. XXVI . 21, 7 cum simulacro
captarum Syracusarum. Cic. Philipp. VIII. 6, 18: de Off. 11.
8, 28p01¹tari in lrimnpllo lllassz'liam vidimus : and many similar
passages. Even images of rivers or river-gods were carried in
triumph : cp.Tac. Ann. II. 41 vecla spolia, captivi, simulacra mon-
lz‘ttm, fluminum, proeliorum. OV. Pont. ΠΙ. 4, 103, Hist. IV.
2, 36.

194. Democritus, the laughing philosopher: cp. Mayor on
Juv. Χ. 28: Cic. de Orat. 11. 58, 235 (note): Sen. de Ira 11. 10, 5
Democritum aiunt nunqnam sine risu in publico fitisse. Pope in
his Imitation takes the same example, but a philosopher, whose
laughter was less easily raised, would have been more to the
point.

195. diversum genus, the accusative retained after apassive
verb, not simply the so-called Greek accusative of respect, as in
V erg. Aen. III. 428 Delphinum caudas utero commissa luporum,
Roby§ 1126, S. G. ξ 471. Orelli, not so well, takes genus as
the nom. in apposition to panthera. ‘A panther mingled in its
unlike nature with a camel ', i.e. the giraffe or camelopard ἐ cp.
