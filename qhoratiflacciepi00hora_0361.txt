some believed that all souls existed independently until the end
of the world’s course, when they would be resolved into the
Divine Being‚ others that only the souls of the wise retained
for a time this independent existence. The Epicureans held
that the soul was dispersed immediately upon death from the
fineness of its atomic composition. Cp. Zeller‚ Stoz'cs ancl
Epicuream, pp. 217, 454. Marc. Aurel. lv. 21. The theory
of the re-absorption of the soul into the sum total of being has

have', not, as Sch'utz, either understandinggcnio, or anticipating
