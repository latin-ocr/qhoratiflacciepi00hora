but no argument can be fairly drawn from this (cp. Gladstone
Juventus lqundz' p. 452). Dionysius (Antiq. Rom. Ι. 61, 153)
says ὅτι δὲ καὶ τὸ τῶν Τρῴων ἔθνος-Ἑλληνικὸν ἐν τοῖς μάλιστα ἣν
ἐκ Πελοποννήσου ποτε ὡρμημένον, εἴρηται μὲν καὶ ἄλλοις τισὶ
πάλαι, λεχθήσεται δὲ καὶ πρὸς ἐμοῦ δι’ ὀλίγωνε but his account
does not include the Phrygians, and is based on the legendary
history of Dardanus. -

duello, the earlier form of bellum, which is derived from it, as
bis from duis διε. (Roby ξ 76, Corssen Ausspr. 1². 124—5):
Horace uses this form in Ep. 11. 1, 254, 11. 2, 983 Carm. 111. 5,
38, 111. 14, 18, 1v. 15, 8. Here, as elsewhere, he seems in-
tentionally to adopt a. mock heroic tone.

8. aestus ⁴ fier-y passions’, (Sat. 1. 2, 110), not, Ι think, here
wi'th any reference to the tide, but with a force more directly
derived from the primary meaning of the word (root idle ‘ burn ²,
as in aestas, αἴθω &c. Curt. Ι. 310). Cp. Ep. 1. 8, 5.

9. Antenor, Liv. 1. 1 Aeneas Antenorque pacis reddendae
que Helenae semper auctores fuerant: cp. Hom. 11. VII. 350
geiir’ olyer', Ἀργείην Ἑλένην καὶ κτήμαθ’ ἅμ’ αὐτῇ δώομεν Ἀτρεί·
ῃσιν α’γειν.

censet praecidere : censeo here has the construction of iubeo,
which is very rare with the activeinfinitive, except in Columella :
for a similar construction with the passive, where the gerundive
might have been expected, cp. Liv. ΙΙ. 5, 1 de bonis regiis, quae
reddi ante censuerant, with Drakenbmch's note, K'uhnast, p. 20,

10. Quid Paris ‘2 just like quidpauper? (Ep. 1. 1. 91). The
reading of Bentley ⁴ Quod Paris, ut salvus regnet vivatque beatus,
cogi posse negat ’, is supported only by inferior MSS. and has
little to recommend it. Cp. 11. V11. 362 ἀντικρύς δ’ ἀπόφημι,
’γυναῖκα μὲν οὐκ ἀποδώσω. For the omission of se before posse cp.
V erg. Aen. 111. 201 ipse diem noctemque negat discernere caelo,

11. Nestor, Hom. 11. 1. 2 54 f., IX. 96 f.

12. inter...int.er, repeated as in Sat. 1. 7, Π, Inter Hectora
Priamiden animosum atque inter Achillem ἱνα fuit capitalis .-
Bentley there (as here) attacks the reading, but it is well supported
by Cicero's practice with interesse, e. g. de Fin. Ι. 9, 30, de Am.
25, 95. Livy X. 7 has the repetition with certatum—Peliden:
the acc. termination -en in the accusative of patronymics is every-
where much better established than the form in -em, and is
often necessary to the metre as in Sat. 1. 7, 11. Cp. Neue
Formenlehre 1. 573 Roby ἓ 473, S. G.‚§ 150. In feminine names
