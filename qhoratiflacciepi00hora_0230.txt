194 HORATI EPISTULAE.

suggestion of thoughtlessness in the Ianguage. Cp. Conington
on Verg. Aen. 1. 102. For the construction with omnis Roma
ep. Carm. 1v. 2, 50 uon semel dicemus ‘io triumphe’ civitas
omnzs.

19. plus quam tibi: Acron well compares for the thought
Pers. I. 7 nec te quaesiveris extra.

20. alium sapiente: alius has the construction of a compara-
tive also in Ep. ΙΙ. 1, 240 alius Lysippo, and in Sat. 11. 3, 208
species alias veris. Cp. Cic. ad Fam. XI. 2 (in a letter written by
Brutus) nec quicquam aliud libertate communi quaesivisse: Roby
‘g' 1268, S. G. ἓ 513. Cp. Xen. Mem. IV. 4, 25 ἄλλα τῶν δικαίων.

21. Sanum: the metaphor, as is frequently the case in these
epistles, is made the main proposition. We should say rather
‘and act like a man who should conceal a disease’ etc.

22. sub ‘up to’: Mr Roby (ἓ 2129) admits for sub with acc.
of time only the meaning ‘just aster' : but usage and the origin
of the construction alike seem to point to ‘towards‚ just before'
as a force quite as legitimate. Cp. Sat. 1. 1, 103 11. 1, 93 7, 33,
1093 and Palmer's notes on the Satires, p. 380.

23. tremor: cp. Pers. 111. 100 ff. Some editors suppose that
the sick man disguises his sever until dinner-time that he may
not have to sacrifice his meal, others that he may spare the feel-
ings of his guests (!): but Horace appears to mean simply that
a vice not cured may break outat the most inconvenient times.

unctis, food was commonly taken in the fingers, forks being
unknown except sor kitchen purposes, and spoons little used:
cp. Ov. A. A. ΙΙΙ. 755 carpe cibos degitis.

24. pudor malus ⁶ a false shame’.

25 —31. Praise only suited lo A agustus you would rcjfuse to
lake to yoztrscff. Why take crcditfor wisdom and virtue?

25. tibi with pugnata, not with dicat: the latter construc-
tion, defended by Schiitz, requires us to give to dicat the meaning
adsignet, which is without authority. The scholiasts however
take tibi: in tuum honorem.

Η 2ί6. vacuas ‘open’ to flattery‚ called by Persius IV. 50
ι n as.

27—28. tene—Iuppiter, a quotation, according to the seho-
liasts, from the panegyricus Augusti by L. Varius, the tragic poet.

30. pateris seems to be the best supported reading: poteris
of some MSS. is only a corruption, and cupias of others a gloss
upon it. For the construction, which is a Grecism, cp. Carm.
1. 2, 43 patiens vocari Caesaris ultam and Ep. 1. 5, 15.
