shall expect you to dinner tlzis evening. I will give you tlte besl
wine J have, and all slzall be ready.

1. Archiacis, so called from the mal-:er Archias (cp. Phidiacus
from Phidias, Pausz'acus from Pausias), a ‘saber lectorius' at
Rome. His couches were evidently not luxurious3 Porphyrion says
they were short3 to which Acron adds that the maker was short
too, on the principle, I suppose, of Dr Johnson’s parody, ‘who
drives fat oxen, should himself be sat'.—The old reading
archciz'cis involves a false quantity. and rests upon no authority
worth considering.—recumbere, as in Carm. 111. 3, 11 and else-
where, for the more usual accumbere.

2. cenare: coenare is a barbarism: the archetype certainly
read holus. not olus. omne generally explained as ‘all sorts
of', not, of course, mixed in a salad, as Macleane supposes; but
equivalent to ‘any kind that may be served up'. Cp. Fabri on
Liv. XXII. 41, 6 casira plena omnis-fortunae publicae privataeque
relinquit. But it is better to take it as ‘ nothing but’: as in Cic.
de Nat. D. ΙΙ. 21, 56 omnis ordo ‘nothing but order' : cp. Halm
on Cic. Cat. 111. 2, 5. So πᾶς is sometimes used in Greek: cp.
Dobree's note on Dem. F. L. ἓ 85 in Shilleto’s edition (not.
crit.). For holus as Horace’s sare, cp. Sat. 11. 1, 74; 2, 117;
6, 643 7, 30; Ep. 1. 17, 15. patena dim. from patina, as
fi’mella sromsemina, lamella from lamina ; Roby ἓ 869.

3. supremo sole ‘at sunset' (cp. primo sole Ov. Met. lx.
933 media sole Phaedr. ΙΙΙ, 19, S), later than was usual, the ninth
hour being that generally chosen sor dinner (Ep. I. 7, 70—713
Mart. 1V. 8, 6). A late dinner would be, according to the
Roman notions, a modest one; just as a banquet which began
early was supposed to be a luxurious one (cp. Sat. 11. 8, 3).
Torquatus would also have time to finish his business, as in
Sat. 11. 7, 33 Maecenas is too busy to dine before the lamps are
lit. Cp. Juv. Ι. 49 exul ab octava illarius bibit (with Mayor's
note).

4. iterum sc. consule. T. Statilius Taurus was consul (along
with Augustus) for a second time in B. C. 263 he was one of the
most eminent rnen of his time at Rome, and had been consul
(suffectus) for the first time in 13.C. 37. In 13.C. 36 he command-
ed a ficet against Sex. Pompeius in Sicily3 in B.C. 34 he received
a triumph sor successes in Africa; at Actium in 13.C. 31 he
commanded the land forces of Augustus3 and in 13.C.29 he
defeated the Cantabri and other Spanish tribes. In κο. 16 he
was left in charge of Rome and Italy during the absence of the
Emperor, with the title of praefectus urba—ilerum is the word
always used osa second consulship: Gellius (Χ. 1) reports an amus·
ing perplexity on the part of Pompeius, as to whether he should
