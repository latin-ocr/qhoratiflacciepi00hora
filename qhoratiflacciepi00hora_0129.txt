Bk. I. Ep. I.] NOTES. 93

{ditors seems to be simply an attempt at emendation. But cp.
'at. 1. 1, 25.

viduas includes the unwedded, as well as the widowed : cp.
Liv. 1. 46, 7 se rectius viduam et illum caelibem futurum fnisse,
where viduam acts as the feminine of caelibem. [The tempting
derivation of the word from vi ‘apart’ and dhavas ‘husband’
must now be abandoned (Curt. Princ. Ι. 46): the root is vidlz ‘to
be empty, lacking ³, occurring also in ἠίθεοι-τ cp. Vanic'ek p. 966.]

79. excipiant, ahunting term, asin Carm.111. 12, 12. vivaria
‘preserves'‚ where animals were kept and sattened: Plin. vill.
52, ‘21 1 says of wild boars vivaria corum ceterarumque silvestrium
primus togati generis invenit Fulvius Lippicus, in Tarquiniensi
firas pascere instituit .· nec diu imitatores ‹le-'fuere L. Lucullus et Q.
Hortensius: so that the custom had not long been introduced in
the time of Horace. In Sat. 11. 5, 44 the cetaria are {ish-pond< ε
a meaning which is possible, but not so probable for vivaria
here.

80. occ‘ulto ‘ secret ’, as being either higher than that legally
allowed, or derived from loans to minors‚ who were protected by
the lex Plaetoria. Possibly‚ however, as Prof. Palnier suggests,
the reference may be rather to the unnoticed growth of interest:
cp. Carni. 1. 12, 45· occulto aevo, and Ar. Nub. 1286 ὑπορρέοντος
του χρονου.

81. esto ‘granted that ’, a common phrase with Horace,
which generally indicates a transition from that which may be
00110εὲεὲ for argument’s sake to another point which cannot be
conce e .

82. Idem nom. plur. durare intrans.

83. sinus ‘ retreat’, not ‘bay'. Baiae was a favourite resort of
the wealthy Romans: cp. Becker's Gallus, sc. VII. ‘All writers
making mention of it concur in this eulogy '.

84. lacus sc. Lucrinus (Carm. 11. 15, 3), mare sc. Tuscum.
The rich man who has taken a sancy to Baiae at once begins build-
ing out into the lake or the sea the subs-tructions for a splendid
villa: cp. Carm. 111. 1, 33—36‚11. 18, 17—22. Baiae itself was
at least two miles sroni the lake, but the whole coast was covered
with villas, and the name was not strictly limited; in fact there
was no distinct town of Baiae. Cp. Dict. Geogr.

85. eri here, as always in Plautus and Terence and in Cic.
de Rep. Ι. 41 according to the palimpsest, much better established
than lzerz' (Ritschl, Opusc. 11. 409): this is however 110 decisive
reason against regarding the li as etymologically justified: cp.
Curt. Princ. 1. 2463 Corssen Ausspr. 12 46& and on the other
hand Brugman in Kuhn's Ztsch. xx111. 953 and see note on de
Orat. 1. 21, 98. vitiosa libido ‘morbid caprice ’-
