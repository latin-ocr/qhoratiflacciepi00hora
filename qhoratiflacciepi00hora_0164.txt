128 ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE.

on Lucret. IV. 1022 (where he similarly reads externantur for
exterrentur, ‘are scared')‚ Haupt, etc. The word is found
twice in Catullus (LXIV. 71‚165) and three times in Ovid

(Met. Ι. 641, XI. 77, Ibis 432 ) in just the sense here required,
and therefore is not ‘unclassical' as Keller says. But extewet

may be defended by Vetg Aen. XI. 806 suffit ante omnes exter-

ritus Arruns laeti'tnz mzxtoque metu (cp. G. 111. 434), Lucr. 11.
1040 novitate exterritus ipsa.

12. gaudeat, etc.‚ ‘whether he rejoices’, etc„ not as Keller
takes it, with a colon at meluatne, the jussive subjunctive. ‘This
classification of the emotions under four heads originated with the
Stoics‚ but in Horace⁷s time had become acommonplace. Cp.
Verg. Aen. VI. 7 33 ltine metuunt cupiuntque, dolent gaudentque,
quoted by Augustine de Civ. D. XIV. 3 as a Stoic echo. Cp.

flaSt. {haed 83 Β ἡδονῶν καὶ ἐπιθυμιῶν καὶ λυπῶν καὶ φόβων.’

13. spe, ‘expectation’, with the ambiguous meaning shown
also in pavor and exterret. This is more common with the verb
spero (cp. Verg. Aen. 1. 543, 11. 658, etc.) than with the sub-
stantive; but cp. Sall. Jug. LXXXVIII. 1 contra spem suam lae-

tissimis am’mzs excipl'lmg Cat. XX. 13 mala res, spes multo
asperior with Kritz's note.

14. defixis oculiS, ‘ Y ou stare, look blank, grow numb from
top to t0e². Con.

16. ultra quam satis est. There is no reason to suppose
(with Macleane) that Horace is speaking either ironically or
‘with an unusual fit of enthusiasm’. The need of moderation in
pursuit even of virtue is a commonplace with philosophers: ep.
Cic. pro Mur. 30, 63 nostri illi a Platone et Aristotele, moderati
homines et temperati az'zmt...0mnes virtutes mediocritate quadam
esse temperatas. Cic. Tusc. IV· 2 5, 55 studia vel optimarum rerum
sedata tamen et tranquilla csse dehent. ib. IV. 29, 62 etiam si vir-
tutis vehementior appetitus sit, eadem est omnibus ad deterrendum
adhibenda oratio.

17—27. Set your lzcart on tlte treasures of art, on fame and

otbz wealdz, ff you will.- lmt remember tlcat you will soon lzave to
cz andan all.

17. Ι nune, ‘go now', an ironical imperative to do something
which under the circumstances is impossible, or at least not to be
expected, usually followed by et, as in Ep. 11. 2, 76. Cp. Pers.

1V. 19 z nunc ..susta‚ where Jahn remarl· s ‘irridentis vel expro-
brantis sormulai’, and gives many other examples.

argentum, here ‘plate’, as in Sat. 1. 4, 28, Juv. 1. 76, etc.; not
‘money’. artis, ‘works of art '‚ cp. Carm. 1v. 8, 5 divite me
