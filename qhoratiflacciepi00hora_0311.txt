Pope's imitation

‘Even copious Dryden wanted or sorgot
The last and greatest art, the art to t⁵l)lot'.

We may remember also, in Ben Jonson’ s Dizsco ενίι s, the criticism
on Shaksp ere: “I remember the players osten mentioned it as
an honour to S. that m his writings ‚ uhatsoever he penned, he
never blotted out a line. My answer hath beer-1, ‘Would he
had blotted out a thousand '.''

168. ex medlo ‘from daily lise '.

arcessit: some of the best MSS. here have accersit. For
a discussion of the relation of the two forms or words cp.
Journal ⁰f Philology, VI. 278 ff. The vet. Bland. has accessit ,-
but it is clearly better to take res as acc. plur. rather than noni.
sing.: the perfect tense is out of place; and if res is the subject
of accessit, it must also be taken as the subject of creditur, in-
stead of comoedia ,· but the latter gives a much more satisfactory
sense.

170. veniae ‘indulgence': even uneducated spectators can
see the absurdities of unnatural comedies.

1⁷1. quo pacto ‘in what a fashion'. Is this intended for
blame or praise? Editors are divided in their jurlgment. Acron
leaves the ambiguity: Porph. has quam indecenter, incongrue:
and so Conington renders

‘What ill-sustained affairs
Are his close fathers and his love-siclt heirsl’

Lambinus on the other hand argued that as Horace in A. P. 270 ff.
blames his rough mette and coarse wit, there would be little lest,
if he did not allow him even the credit of vigorous character-
painting: and Schiitz points out that in criticizing Roman tragedy
Horace first reeognizes merit, then adds blame, and that the blame
in the case of Plautus comes in clearly in v. 174. But Horace is
here pointing out that comedy, though thought to be easy, is
really difficult, and it is not unnatural that he should at once give
proofs of his position. That the criticisrn is hardly warranted‚

and that Plautus really shows much power in his vivid sketches
of character, is not reason enough for us to reject an interpreta-

tion which would show that Horace judged a popular savourite
too severely. Hence the expression ‘Look at the way in which
Plautus sustains, &e.’ may fairly be regarded as implying
censure.
