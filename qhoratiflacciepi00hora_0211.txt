Bk. 1. Ep. XIV.] NOTES. 175

30 sperata victoria) : hence we may fairly translate by the present.
Horace wishes to indicate that his estate, though small, is no
eontemptible one, and it is more to the purpose to refer to its
present tenants than to its¹ past occupiers. The eight operae
doubtless tilled the ‘home-sarm' under the vilicus. The patres
were probably free coloni (Carm. Ι. 3 5, 6 pauper ruris colonus .-
11. 14, 12 sive inopes [rimus coloni), who tilled the rest of the
estate, paying to Horace as the dominns either a fixcd rent, or
as so osten now in Italy, a portion os the produce. In the
former case they would be said ad pecuniam numeratam con-
ducffe, in the latter they were called partiaris, i. e. me‘tayers.
Cp. Dig. XIX. ¹2, 25, ἓ 6. Others, less plausibly, suppose them
to have been free hired labourers‚ under the direction of the
vilicus. Sir T. Martin, for instance (Life os Horace, p. lxxiv.)‚
says ‘the farm gave employment to five families of free coloni,
who were under the superintendence of a bailiff: and the poet's
domestic establishlnent was composed of eight slaves’. His
version is inconsistent with this view, but not, Ι think, less in-

correct :—

‘That small domain which, though you hold it cheap,
‹Suffieed of old five families to keep,

And into Varia sent, in days gone by,

Five worthy heads of houses.'

Conington’s rendering,

‘Which though ye suiff at it, could once support
Five hearths and send sive statesmen to the court’

might be misleading to one not familiar with the provincial use os
‘statesman' sor a small landholder (cp. Halliwell's Dict. s. v.).
He evidently regards the ῥαίνω as Horace’s predecessors in the
ownership of the estate.

focis ‘households' : cp. Herod. Ι. 176 αἱ δὲ ὀγδώκοντα ἱστίαι
αὗται ἔτυχον τηνικαῦτα. ἐκδημέουσαι, καὶ οὕτω περιεγένοντο.

3. Variam, a town on the Anio, eight miles above Tibur, on
the via Valeria, just where the valley of the Digentia, in which
Horace’s estate lay, joined that of the Anio. The patres probably
went there to market, and sor local elections etc. It is now

called Vicovaro.

4. spinas used of vices or lesser sailings in Ep. 11. 2. 212.
Cp. also Sat. 1. 3, 34—37. ‘Let us see which can root out the
thorns the more stoutly, 1 from my breast, or you from the land.'

5. res=sundus.
