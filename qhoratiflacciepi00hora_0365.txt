Bk. II. Ep. IL] NOTES. 329

212. levat is much more pointed than iuvat, and is adopted
by most good recent editors since Bentley, though it has not
much Ms. authority. Cruquius quotes it srom three codd.
Bland. Cp. Epod. 11, 173 20; Carm. Saec. 635 Sat. 11. 3,
292; Ep. 1. 8, 8. spinis: Ep. 1. 14, 4.

213. recte ‘aright', i.e. in accordance with virtue: so
rectum = κατόρθωμα.

decede peritis ‘make way sor those who· have learnt the
lesson’: peritis is dat. as in Verg. Ecl. V111. 88 serae decedere
nocti. Cp. Lucr. IV. 962 agedum gnatis concede.

214. lusisti: ‘ludere ubi cum verbis edendi bibendique
consociatur, semper amoris ludum denotat, ut in Graeco παίζειν,
ἐσθίειν, πίνειν’ (Ritter); cp. Carm. 111. 12, 1 amoridare ludum.
Festus (p. 11 M.) quotes from Livius Andronicus affalim cas,
bibi, lusi, probably a mistranslation of Hom. Od. xv. 372.
(Mommsen 11. 420: but cp. NVordsworffi, Fragments and Ape-
timens, p. 569.) So Arrian Exped. Alex. 11. 5, 5 translates the
epitaph on Sardanapallus (srom the Assyrian) σὺ δὲ, ὦ ξένε,
ἔσθιε καὶ πῖνε καὶ παῖζε, ὡς τᾶλλα τὰ ἀνθρώπινα οὐκ ὄντα τούτου
ἄξια, while Plutarch de Fort. Alex. 11. p. 336 C. has ἔσθιε, πῖνε,
ἀφροδισίαζε· τᾶλλα δέ οὐδέν.

215. abire as from a banquet, or the comissatio which
followed. Cp. Sat. 1. 1, 1193 and Lucret. 111. 938.

216. lasciva decentius ‘that may more becomingly make
merry’, cp. A. P. 106: the reading liccnlz'us has very slight sup-
port, and only comes from Carm. 1. 19, 3 et lasciva Licentia.

pulset ‘drive you out'.
