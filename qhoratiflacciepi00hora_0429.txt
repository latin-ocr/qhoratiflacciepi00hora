NOTES. 393

no means requires us to assume the existence of a third homo-
nymous town. The words of Horace here are evidently used
loosely. If a commentator came across the phrase ‘Ten Karls-
bads would not eure you ’‚ he would hardly think necessary to
determine the geographical position of all the ten.

301. tonsori Licino. According to Acron and Schol. Cruq.
Licinus was a barber, who was made a senator by Caesar because
of his enmity to Pompeius, There was a Licinus who' was a
Gaul, taken prisoner by Caesar, and made his-dispensator.- he
was afterwards emancipated and high in favour with Augustus,
who made him procurator of Gaul in 13.C. 16 and 15. There he
acquired great wealth, which became proverbial ι cp. Pers. ΙΙ. 36,
Juv. Ι. 109 ego possideo plus Pallante et Licinis (with Mayor's
note); XIV. 305 praedives Licinus: Son. Ep. cxx. ‘zo quorum
nomina cum Crasso Licinoque numerantur. On him was written
the excellent epigram (commonly but wrongly ascribed to Varro
Atacinus), quoted here by the scholiasts: Illarmoreo tumulo
Licinus iacet, at Cato nullo, Pompeius parvo: quis putet esse deos?
The good reply to this couplet is modern: cp. Madv. Opusc. 11.
pp. 202—-43 and hence correct Simeox Lat. Lz't. Ι. 247.—It is
commonly assumed that Licinus, the wealthy freedman, was the
barber of the text. The evidence in favour of this is simply that
the scholiasts quote as written of the latter the epigram upon the
former. It is extremely doubtful whether Horace would have
allowed himself this contemptuous reference to the former pro-
fession of one high in favour with Augustus: and even if we
accept the later date assigned to this work, there is no trace of a
loss of this favour, such as Orelli is obliged to assume. Ritter
needlessly assumes three of the name. The simplest way is to
reject altogether the story of the schohasts, that the barber be-
came a senator, along with the absurd reason for it. So Diet.

o ego laevus: ‘how stupid I am.’

302. purgor will stand very well; purger, which Peerlkamp
proposes, would have been more usual; but it is only found in
two unimportant MSS. Cp. Seneca quoted by Roby ἓ 1683
nunquam, inquit Cornelia, non felicem me dicam, qnae Gracchos
peperi. The verb is here used strictly in a middle sense, like
καθαίρομαι, hence bilem is not exactly a Greek accusative, as
Orelli calls it; cp. Robyg 1102, 1126--7‚ S. G. ξ 462, 471.

sub...horam ‘in the season of spring't cp. Carni. 1. 12, 16
variis horis. We might well translate here ‘as the season of
spring comes on’: cp. Ep. Ι. 16, 22 (note), 11. 2, 169, Zumpt
§319‚ and Capes on Liv. xxr. 2, 1 (oddly misinterpreted in L.
and S..) Celsus ΙΙ. 13 says that hellebore, which was a strong
purgative, is best taken in spring3 and Porph. here has omncs
