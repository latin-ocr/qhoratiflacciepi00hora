‘elder’, an impossible meaning, or (with Macleane) as a
‘familiam half jocular’ mode of address. The usual order is
inverted as in Crispe Sallusti, Carm. 11. 2, 3: Hirpine Quinti

ξ 420, ξ 1170: cp. Neue Formenlehre, Ι. ²32· Praeneste was
a favourite retreat for Horace, especially in summer (Carm. 111.
4, 22 frigidum Praeneste),¹ but there is no reason to suppose that
he had a villa here, as has been asserted.

4. planius is supported by better authority than plenius ,-
besides, Chrysippus is said to have written 750 books, and the
commentarii of Crantor extended to 30,000 lines (Diog. Laert. IV.
24), so that plenius would be a singularly ill-chosen term. Chry-
sippus, ‘the second founder of Stoicism’ (εἰ μὴ Ύὰρ ἣν Χρύσιππος,
οὐκ ἂν ἦν Στοά), who boasted that he had furnished the proofs of
the doctrines supplied to him by Cleanthes, was noted for his dry
and obscure style (Cic. de Orat. 1. 11, 50 τ Zeller Stoz‘cs 45—48):
Crantor was said to have been the first to expound the writings
of Plato, and Cicero warmly praises his work on Sorrow (περὶ
πένθους); he assisted Pol'e1n0‚ the fourth head of the Academy,
and in Academia vel imprimis ficit nobilis (Cic. Tuse. 111. 6, 12).

5. distinet was undoubtedly (according to Keller) the reading
of the archetype: detinet (adopted by many recent editors) only
a correction of the corrupt destinet, which is found in some MSS.
Orelli’s dictum, that detinet is used of an agreeable hindrance,
distinet of an unpleasant one, will not bear examinati0n‚ though
the latter is commonly thus used: e.g'. Carm. 1v. 5, 12.—1t is
not certain whether crediderim would have been credidi ‘ I
formed this opinion ' <Roby ξ 1450) or crediderim (Roby ἕ 1560)
in direct speech ς probably the former.

πᾶς μὴἽΕλλην βάρβαρος. Ennius in Cic. Tusc. Ι. 35, 85 adstante
ope barbarica. The Phrygiam language was closely related to
the Greek (Curt. Hist. of Greece Ι. 35, 75; Fick Spraclzez'nheit
Europas pp. 409 ff), but probably not more closelyv than the
Latin, a ,connexion which did not prevent the Greeks from
speaking of the Romans as barbari (cp. Plaut. Asin. prol. 10,
Trin. prol. 19), and Italy as barbaria (Poen. 111. 2, 21). Homer
in the Iliad nowhere represents the Trojans as unintelligible to
the Greeks, and uses βαρβαρόφωνοι only of the Carians (11. 867),
