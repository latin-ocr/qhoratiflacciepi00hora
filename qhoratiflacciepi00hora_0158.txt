noon-day siesta. dies τ if the birthday of Augustus is meant, this
is marked in the Calendars as M), a sign which, as Mommsen
(C. I. Lat. 1. 367) has shown, denotes the day as a dz'esferz'atus,
on which no business was to be done. Hence Torquatus would
not have to appear in the law-courts.

12. quo mim fortunam: the MSS. are pretty equally
divided between this reading and fortuna: Munro says (Introd.
p. 32) that ⁶ all the best MSS.' have the latter, and Ritter seems
to agree: but Keller stoutly denies this, and thinks that the
balance turns the other way. Unsortunately the usage of the
language does not give us much help in deciding between the
two. The accusative occurs in Ovid Am. ΙΙΙ. 4, 41 quo tibi for-
mosam, si mm nisi casta placebat? and 111 ΙΙ. 19, 7 quo mzlzz‘ for,—
tmzam, quac nimquamfall 7e curet? Phaedr. ΙΙΙ. 18, 9 qno mi,
z‘ssazqzczt mulam spcczcm, sz vuzcm sono. In these cases it might be
argued, as here, that the difference between sm tuna and sonunt}
(the way of 11 r1t1ng the accusative in many MSS.)' 15 50 slight
that MS. evidence is of little value. But that the accusative is
legitimate is put beyond a doubt by Ov. Amor. 111. 7, 49 quo
mz'lzz‘ forlunae lantum ? Met. X 111. 103 quo tamen haec Jtlzaco?
and by Cato Distich. 4, 16 quo tibi divitias, si semper pauper
abundas? Cp. Ar. Lysistr. 193 ποῖ λευκὸν 'twa-0113 and Markland’s
note on Stat. Silv. 1. 2, 188. On the other hand, that the abla-
tive is also legitimate has been made very probable by Conington
in his defence of the MS. reading quo nnnc certamine tanto? in
Aen. Ιν. 98, although there even Kennedy accepts the conjecture
certamina tanta. On the whole, as the accusative is the more
certainly established construction, and has plenty of authority
here, it is safer to read fortunam. The accusative is governed
by some verb understood, though what particular verb is to be
supplied was probably not distinctly conceived (cp. Roby
ἐξ 1128, 1441. · S. G. ξ472, 5.83) For quo, which is certainly
not to be regarded with Orelli as a form of the old dative quoi,
cp. Sat. 1. 6, 24 and Roby 11. p. xxx note. fortunam—‘ wealth'‚
a meaning in which the plural is much more common in
Classical Latin.

13. ob heredis curam: cp. Carm. IV. 7, 19. The bitterness
with which the prospect of wealth passing to an heir was viewed,
w as naturally incr eased by the childlessness so common at this time
at Rome. Augustus, Maecenas, Horace and Vergil all left no
son. Cp. Pind. Ol. XI. 88 ἐπεὶ πλοῦτος ὁ λαχὼν ποιμένα’ επακτὸν
ἀλλότριον θνάσκοντι στυγερώτατος.

14. adsidetz‘ is next (1001 to’, the metaphor being probably
derived from the seats in the theatre, where those of the same
social position were ranged together. The word seems to be used
nowhere else in this sense.
