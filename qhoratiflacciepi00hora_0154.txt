Cicero (in Pis. 16, 37) addi-esses Piso as Epicure noster, ex Ιιανίι
producte, mm ex schola. The character of Epicurus himself was
not open to the charge of undue indulgence in sensual pleasures.
Cp. Aelian Var. Hist. lv. 13, ‘Epicurus the Gargettian cried
aloud and said “To whom a little is not enough, nothing is
enough. Give me a barley-cake and water, and I am ready to
vie even with Zeus in happiness.''’

EPISTLE V.

The Torquatus who is here addressed is doubtlcss the one
addressed in Carm. 1V. 7, 23, where Horace mentions his
eloquence, a suitable compliment sor an advocate (l. 31). But
it is difficult to identify him with any one of the names
known to history. There was a L. Manlius Torquatus, consul
in the year of Horace's birth: his son was killed in Africa
in B.C. 48 (Cic. Brut. 76, 265; Bell. Afric. 96), but he may
have left a son of about the same age as Horace: this how-
ever is pure conjecture. The A. Torquatus, whom Atticus
aided after the battle of Philippi (Corn. Nep. Att. c. XL,
cp. c. XV) is mentioned in the latter place so as to suggest that
he was considerably older than Horace. Some have suggested
C. Nonius Asprenas, on whom Augustus conferred the surname
Torquatus with the right to wear a gold chain, out of sympathy
for an accident which he had met with in the ‘Trojan game’,
(so Dict. Biog.); but if young enough to have taken part in the
Trojan garne when revived by Augustus (not apparently before
B.C. 28), he is not likely to have been so intimate with Horace.
It is best to assume that he was some Manlius Torquatus, not
otherwise known. There is nothing to determine the date of
the Epissse, unless we accept Ritter’s interpretation of 1. 9, which
would place it definitely in the summer of B.C. 20: but it must
have been written at least a year or two, probably somewhat
more, after the second consulship of Statilius Taurus in B.C. 26.
Horace invites the busy and wealthy advocate to a simple dinner
with him, if he can put up with the plain sare, which he will
surnish.
