Bk. Ι. Ep. ΧΙΙΙ.] NOTES. 173

tribulis properly means a man os the same tribe, and perhaps
it is best taken so here, the notion being that a wealthy man at
Rome has invited to dinner a poor member of the sanie tribe,
living in the country, doubtless with a view to his vote and
interest. But as the mbas carne to be used in contrast with the
equites and the Senate (cp. Mart. VIII. 15, 3 dat papulus, dat
gratus eques, dat tura Senatus, ct ditant Latias tertia dona tribus)
so tribulis acquired the meaning of plebeian : cp. Mart. lx. 50,
7 of a toga nunc anus et tranulo vix acsz‘pz'cnda tribuli, ib. 58, 8.
Hence it is possible that this may be the meaning here : but we
have no evidence os this soree of the word in the time of Horace.
The humble guest comes bringing under his arm the dress-shoes
(soleae) in which he would be expected to appear in the (lining-
room, although he would put thern off when he took his place at
table (Sat. II. 8, 77), and the felt cap which he would need when he
went home at night. He cannot afford to come in a litter, nor
even to have a slave to attend upon him.

16. Ne seems to have far more support than Bentley's neu
or L. Miiller's nec and there is something not unpleasant in the
abruptness, even if we retain the serni-colon at Caesaris. The
stress lies on the last word. Vinius is not to tell everybody that
the reason why heis in such hot haste is that he is on his way
to Augustus.

nane& evidently'irnperative here. Cp. l. 4.

18. nitere porro, ‘push on’. Horace humorously supposes
that people will come crowding round his messenger, eager to
know what he has brought. Bentley (without remark, and
Orelli supposes, by accident) printed nitere. porro, and this read-
ing has been adopted by some editors; but nitere seems to
require an adverb much more than vade, and the rhythm is
certainly against the pause aster the fifth foot. Forporro of place,
not time, cp. Liv. Ι. 7, 6 agereporro armentum occepit ; IX. 2, 8
si ire porro pergas.

19. cave, scanned, as so osten in Plautus and Terence, cdvt:
cp. Sat. II. 3, 38, 1773 5, 75; the pronunciation cau is not on
the whole so probable, though apparently supported by the story
in Cic. de Div. ΙΙ. 40, 84. Persius (Ι. 108) has maie<

titubes often used, like our ‘trip’‚ os blundering generally
(cp. Ter. Haut. 361 verum illa nequid titubet, and Plaut. Pseud.
939 at vide ne titubes, Mil. 248, 946 δὶα), but here still keeping
up the jest of v. 10: if an ass were to stumble and fall, he might
smash his load, if fragile, as Horace represents his poetry to be.
At the same time, as Orelli points out, we find the phrases
foedus, fidem, iura or leges frangere.
