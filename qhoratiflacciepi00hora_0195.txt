Bk. I. Ep. X.] NOTES. 159

victory. of which the fable has no trace3 and as Bentley shows
no epithet to victor is really wanted. Haupt’s victo ridens is an
ideal emendation so sar as the ductus litterarum goe& and
answers to the phrase in Phaedrus (lv. 3, 5) where a like table is
told of the horse and the boar, quenz dorso levans, it in hoslem
laetus. The horse may doubtless be permitted to laugh as a
sign of triumph in sable. Bentley had already suggested victo,
and the addition of the 7¹ is still more easily explained if the next
word began with that letter.

39. ’ metallis ε a considerable portion os the Roman vectzgralm
was derived from mines in the provinces. Those in Italy were
forbidden by a decree of the senate to be worked. Cp. Dict. Ant.
p. 1184 b. Plin. N. H. xxxnr. 78.

δ 40. ι improbus ‘in his greed :’ vehet has a great predominance
of authority in its favour, and is not to be rejected for vehit
simply on the ground of the preceding caret, nor need we regard
it as assimilated to the following subjunctives.

, 42. olim of any indefinite time, as in Sat. 1. 1, 25 ut pueris
olim dant crustula blandi doctam, Plaut. Mil. 2 clarior quam
solis radii esse olim quam sudumst solmt.

43. uret ‘will gall’‚ Ep. 1. 13. 6; Prop. IV. (V.) 3, 23 num
teneros urit lorica lacertos? so uri ‘to sniart’ in Sat. 11. 7, 58;
Ep. 1. 16, 47. As in Ep. Ι. 1, 23 7, 74, etc. the main thought
and the comparison are blended in the form of the expression.
If a man has a fortune too large for his position and needs, he
will be led into extravagance and so ruined ; if he has too small
a one, he will be pinched.

44. laetus ‘if you are well pleased with your lot’: vives is
the future after an expression, equivalent to a hypothetical clause.
analogous to the subjunctives in Roby ἓ 1534? but dimittes
is equivalent to an imperative, Roby ξ 1589, S. G. ἓ 665 (b).

45. plura cogere, the last reproaeh, one would think, to
which Horace was open.

46. cessare. Ep. 1. 7, 57.

48. tortum digna sequi...funem: the general meaning os
the metaphor is plain enough: its exact reference has been much
disputed. Various commentators have thought of a prisoner led
by his captor, an animal led to sacrifice, a rope wound round a
windlass‚ a tow-rope, the ‘tug of war '‚ or even of a dance (cp.tn
inter em restim ductans saltabis, Ter. Ad. 7 52, Spengel). As
tortus is a standing epithet of a rope (Verg. Aen. ιν. 575ς
Ον. Met. 111. 679; Catull. LXIV. 235, Pers. V. 146), no special
force need be assigned to it here : hence the first or second view
