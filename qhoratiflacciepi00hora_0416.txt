380 ARS POETJCA.

225—233. But in the satyrio drama care must be taken tlzat
tlte language z‘s not low, ον on the other leand bomhastic.

225. ita...ne‚ less common than ita...ut: but cp. v. 151.
commendare, i.e. to try to win the favour of the audience sor
the satyrs, by putting jests into their mouths.

226. seria. Ritter seems to be right in taking of the grave
language of the heroic characters in the satyric drama, ludo of
the jests of the chorus of satyrs: ‘to pass from grave to gay ².

228. nuper, not necessarily in a tragedy performed on the
same day, though, as Ritter sayS‚ when this was the case, it
would give additional point to the warning: nuper is used with
great latitude of meaning.

229. migret in tabernas ‘ should descend to dingy hovels’‚
i.e. use the language common in such places: tabernae usually
denotes booths or workshops, as in Cic. in Cat. IV. 8, 17, Acad.
11. 47, 144, and very rarely (without any qualifying adjective)
taverns3 so there is no need to take it so here, as Macleane does,
or to suppose that obscuras indicates that they were underground.
Cp.pauperzcm tabernas in Carm. Ι. 4, 13.

230. vitat would more regularly have been vitet (which is
found in a few inferior MSS.) in a sentence subordinate to captes:
but dum is so constantly used with the pres. indic. that the con-
struction is retaIned here even against the rule.

nubes et inania, i.e. high-flown‚ empty verbiage, especially
out of keeping with the general tone of the drama.

231. effutire indigna: sor the infinitive'cp. Ep. Ι. 3, 353
Sat. 1. 4, 3 dignus describi. Roby ἓ 1361, S. G. ἓ 540 (2). For
fictis and cognate words cp. Curt. Gr. Et. Ι. p. 252.

232. moveri Ep. 11. 2, 125: ‘sunt enim quaedam sacra, in
quibus saltant matronae, sicut in sacris Matris deum' Acron.
This refers doubtless to the Hilaria on March 25th z cp. Marquardt
Rom. St. ΙΙΙ. 357. So too of Licymnia (probably intended sor
Terentia, the wife of Maecenas) in Carm. 11. 12, 17 quam nec
ferre pedem dedecuit choris, nec cerfare ioco, nec dare bracchia
ladcntem nitidis vitginibus sacro Dianae celebris die. For the
way in which dancing was generally regarded cp. Sall. Cat. XXV.
Sempronia...saltare elegantius qnam necesse est probae, where
Cook quotes Servius on Verg. Georg. Ι. 350 saltationem aptam
religioni nec ex ulla arte venientem.

234—243. T lze languagre of the satyris drama is to be some-
thing between tlzat ostJ'ageze'y and that of comedy.
