390 ARS POETICA.

282. excidit, not as Schiitz ex laude, but rather as Orelli
puts it, ’παρρησία impetu quodam suo delapsa est in petulantiam '.
ex- denotes the change from a previous state, but it is not neces-
sary that what this state was should be indicated in the context.

283. lege: Suidas s.v. Ἀντίμαχος says ἐδόκει οὗτος ψήφισμα
πεποιηκέναι μὴ δεῖν κωμῳδεῖν ἐξ ὀνόματοςι this was in B.C. 4403
but the law was repealed three years afterwards. The law
passed by Syracosius (B.C. 415) seems to have been solely to
restrict comic writers from taking as their subject the profanation
of the mysteries. Cp. Meineke Com. Gr. Fr. 11. 949. The
olffgarclis of B.C. 411 seem to have silenced political comedy by
terror not by law.

284. turpiter must go with obticuit3 the disgrace lay in
the fact that the outrageous violence of the chorus had brought
upon it the restraint of the law.

285—294. Versalz‘lity and talent are by no means wanting to
tlze Roman poets: tllcy have even slzown orzgrv'naliqr in tlte dramas
taken from their national bimum tlzey miglzt rival tlze Greeks zs
llzey were not so deficient in patie‘ntfinislz.

288. praetextas. On the analogy of togata and palliata
this word, which is derived from the toga praetexta worn by
magistrates at Rome, ought to be praetextata; and this formis
that usual in the grammarians. But Asinius Pollio in writing to
Cicero (Ep. X. 32, 3 and 5) twice uses praetexta: so does the
writer of the ancient life of Persius, ascribed to Suetonius,
scrz'pi‘z't etiam Flaccus iu puerilia praetextam: and Paulus p. 223
M. has praetextae appellantur qnae res gestas Romanorum babent
scriptas, where Muller calls this form the more correct. The
fabula praetextata was first written by Naevius, who composed
two on the early history of Rome, Lupus and Romulus—the
latter possibly the earliest source of the familiar legend—and one
Clastidium, on contemporary history, all three of great merit,
according to Ribbeck: cp. leam. Trag. pp. 63——7 5. Two prae-
textae are ascribed to Ennius, one to Pacuvius, and two to
Accius. (For the comoedia tigata of Afranius and others, cp. Ep.
11. 1, 57 note).

290. unum quemque: cp. Ep. 11. 2, 188 (note). Orelli
thinks that by ‘a malicious irony' Horace is here illustrating the
carelessness which he censures: but no such explanation suits
the parallel instances.

292. Pompilius sanguis, the nominative for the vocative in
solemn address as in Carm. 1. 2, 43 almae filius Maiae: Livy
has not only audi tu, populus Albanus (1. 24, 7), but even agedum
pontifex publicus populi Romani (VIII. 9, 4) : cp. too Verg. Aen.
