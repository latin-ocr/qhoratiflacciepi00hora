NOTES. 335

the young Pisos are warned of the difficulties which surround
the poet who is not fitted by learning, genius, and painstaking
labour for his high vocation. The further development of these
general divisions must be reserved for the running analysis. But
one point calls for further remark, in the space which is given to
the criticism of the drama. While only 24 lines are assigned
to epic poetry, no less than 170 are devoted to dramatic poetry.
F or* this various reasons have been given. It has been suggested
that Horace himself, who was certainly not without dramatic
power, may have contemplated writing for the stage, at the time
when his somewhat scanty fountain of lyrical inspiration seemed
to be running dry. Others have found the explanation in the
hypothesis that the young Pisos had shown tendencies in that
direction. But without denying the possibility of either of these
suppositions‚ it may be suggested that Horace has rather in view
the awakened interest in the drama, prevalent in his own day,
and among his own set. In the generation of Cicero dramatic
literature had fallen out of favour; and though Quintus Cicero
was proud of having written four tragedies in sixteen dayS‚ the
rapidity of the productiori shows how little it was regarded as a
serious pursuit. But of Horace’s contemporaries some of those
of highest mark had devoted themselves to tragedy. Asinius
Pollio, Varius, and Ovid, all won high distinction in this branch
of literature, and although Augustus had the good sense to cancel
his own tragedy of Ajax‚ the fact that he had written it shows
the direction which the current was taking. It is probable that
Horace, in devoting so much attention to the criticism of the
drama, did so in recognition of the prevalent literary tristes, and
with the wish to influence them in the direction of profounder
study of the true ¹classical models.

Porphyrion says primum praeceptum est περὶ τῆς ἀκολουθίας, i.e.
consistency in dealing with the several portions (vv. 1—9). Prof.
N ettleship suggests that the praeceptum of Neoptolemus is trans-
lated or paraphrased in vv. 1—5, and that 6-9 form Horace's
comment. In painting the neglect of organic unity results in a
ridiculous monster : the effect is not less absurd in poetry.

1. humano —eqm'nam: the inverted order (clzz'asmus) adds
emphasis. For creatures ‘ex alienigenis membris compacta' cp.
Lucret. V. 878 ff. Perhaps we may suppose Horace to be thinking
especially of a centaur, a harpy and Scylla.
