8. urtica. ‘nettles’, according to Plin. XXI. 55, 15 and
Celsus ΙΙ. 20 a common article of sood among the poor, as indeed
they are still. Sea-urchins (urtica marina> are a delicacy, and
cannot be meant here. ’

sic vives protinus ‘you will go on to live in the same way’.
ut ‘even if’, R0by§ [7063 S. G. ς’ 714 (d).

9. Fortunae rivus, apparently a somewhat inaccurate remi-
niscence of the story of Midas, who by bathing in the Pactolus
transferred to that river his fatal gift of turning all that he
touched to gold. Cp. Ov. Met. XI. Μαι-5 rex iussae succedit
aquae: vis aurea tinxit flamen ct humano de corpore cessit z'n
amnem. Mmc quoque iam veleris percepto semine venae arva
rigent, auro 77zadidz's palleull'a glaebis. But Prop. Ι. 14, 11 tum
milli Pactoli veniunt snb lecta liquores, shows how proverbial
the reference had become. For the derivation of confestim
cp. Roby 1. p. 220 note. It is not certain, however, that
there was not a form of the root scd as well as send, to which
this group of words might be referred: cp. Vanicek p. 392.

10. vel quia...ve1 quia : i.e. isa man's previous abstemious-
ness was due to a love of economy, this will not be changed with
his fortune; or if it was due to a contempt for pleasure in com-
parison with virtue, this will be equally unchanged.

11. cuncta, as the Stoics would teach.

critas ilc not neglecling yozn‘ dulles, and yet conlz'nzzz‘ng your
interest in philosophy.

12. miramur ‘we wonder', not in admiration, but rather
in astonishment that a philosopher should be so abstracted‚
although it is much more astonishing that you with all your
business cares should find leisure sor such prosound enquiries.

pecus edit agellos: cp. Cic. de Fin. v. 29, 87 Democritus...
ut quam minime animus α agitationibus abduceretur, patri-
monium neglexit, agros deseruit incultos. Zeller doubts even the
statement that he neglected his property, much more the exag-
gerated stories connected with it. Cp. Fre-Socratis Philosophy
11. 213 note.

13. peregre est ‘was roaming’.
c 1132. 1cu4m It? ‘and that though you'. inter ‘surrounded by',
p. ⁴ p. . ‚ .

scabiem et contagia lucri ‘contagious itching sor pelf’.
Iccius must have been frequently brought into contact with
men whose hearts were set upon making money, but was not
carried away by their example.
