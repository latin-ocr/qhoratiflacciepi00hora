the drift of the passage is tenable, then communia will retain its
usual meaning in rhetoriczvolgarz'a (cp. κοινὰ ὀνόματαεέν μέσῳ
κείμενα Ernest. Lex. Techn. p. 183); and will be identical with
publica materies, not as ‘what is open to all’, but as ‘what is
familiar to all’. Translate then with Conington (p. 199 note),
‘It is hard to treat hackneyed subjects with orig'inality'. This
interpretation is found (among others) in the Schol. Cruq. The
first view has the weighty support of Prof. Nettleship (Jonrn.
Plzz'l.X11. 52 note), but Ι think the third is on the whole the

gest. There is a discussion of the passage in Boswell’s szse qf
ο Inson, c. XXX.

129. deducis...proferres: the tense and mood of these two
verbs require us to suppose that Piso was already engaged upon
a tragedy based upon the Iliad, and are hardly consistent with
Nettleship's view that Horace is referring here solely to epic
poetry. It is not legitimate to say, with Ritter, that deducis
would in prose have been detineas. The metaphor is the fami-
liar one from spinning3 cp. Ep. 11. 1, 225: hence the reading
diducis of some MSS. is out of place. Aristotle (Poet. ²3) says
that the Iliad and the Odyssey surnish material for one or at
most two tragedies each, while several could be made from

Cyclic poems such as the Little Iliad or the Cypria. But cp.
Mahaffy, Gr. Lz'l. 1. 83.

131. publica materies, according to Orelli’s view of this
passage, the store of mythic and epic stories, from which all
might draw at will. But it is better to take it as ‘themes
already handled', which can be made all a poet's own, by origi-
nality of treatment. Orelli's own example of the story of
Electra, as treated by Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, is a
very good one, but less applicable to his own view, than to that
here preferred. Cp. Milton's name ‘sad Electra's poet'‚ which
shows how he thought that Euripides had appropriated the
theme.

132. vilem patulumque orbem ‘the cheap and easy round’
of the mode of treatment previously adopted. A familiar theme
may be so treated that the situations which it produces may be
viewed in a different light, and the reflexions (sententiae) sug-
gested may be quite fresh. Of this there is a splendid example
in Browning’s Balaustim’s Adventare. Ι do not think that
Schiitz is right in referring orbis to a set of familiar stories, sor
which Ritter reminds us that κύκλος was the technical name3
and certainly Orelli’s quotations of τὰ κύκλῳ from Aristotle's
Rhetoric are quite misleading, and his rendering ‘round-about
phrases' highly improbable.

133. verbo verbum reddere. The earlier Roman dramatists
often did little more than translate very closely their Greek ori-
