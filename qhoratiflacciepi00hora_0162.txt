1 26 ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE.

1. nil admirari corresponds to Tennyson’s ‘wise indifference
of the wise ’, the ἀταραξία of the Epieureans, sor apud Epicurum
duo bona sunt, ex quibus summum illud beatumque componitur,
ut cmpus siue dolore sit, animus siue perturbatione (Seneca Ep. 66,
45), the ἀπάθεια of the Stoics, to whom all emotions were for-
bidden (Cic. Acad. 11. 43, 135), except in the modified form of
εὐπάθειαι (Zeller, Sloz'cs‚ pp. 253, 291). The admirari would
naturally bring along with it the optare and expetere, with which
it is osten conjoined3 eg. Cic. de Off. Ι. 20, 66, where one of
the marks os a ‘fortis animus ct magnus ² is cum persuasum est
nillil hominem nz‘sz' quod honestum decorumque sit aut admirari
aut optare aut emerere oportere.

3. hunc ‘ yon ’.

4. momentis ‘courses', the τροπὴ of Epicurus in Diog.
Laert. X. 76, not of time, as in Sat. Ι. 1. 7. Cp. Ep. Ι. 10, 16.

formidine ‘dread ², i.e. superstitious alarm.

5. imbuti: cp. Ep. Ι. 2, 69 (note), and Cic. de Fin.1. 18‚60
superstitio, qua qui est imbutus, quietus esse nunquam potest:
hence translate ‘ without a touch of dread '. spectent: the in-
dicative has very little authority and is quite indesensible.

quid merely introduces the question, as in Cic. de Off. 11. 7, 25
quid censemus superiorem illum Dionysium, quo cruciatu timoris
augi solitum ‚2 de Orat. 1. 17, 79 quid censes, si ad alicuius inge-
nium vel maius illa, quae ego mm atligi, accesserint, qualem illum
et quantum oratorem futurum ,9 pro Rosc. 17, 49 quid censes
hunc ipsum Sex. Roscium, quo studio et quo intellegentia esse in
rusticis rebus ? Macleane's interpretation ‘ what do you suppose
they think ² διο. is quite baseless.

7. ludicra quid, plausus, ete. This line has been punctuated
and explained in at least five different ways: (1) ludicra quid,
plausus, ludicra being then translated ‘games’: the objections
to this are (α) that although the singular is osten so used,
there is no authority for the plural; but cp. Madvig on Cic.
de Fin. Ι. 20, 69: (h) that with et following, another copula
is needed before plausus: (c) that, if the games are regarded
from the stand-point of the giver‚ they are not naturally an
object of admiration3 if from the spectator's point of view, there
is an abruptness in passing on to the prizes of ambition. (2) lu-
dicra quid plausus, plausus being the genitive after ludicra ‘the
toys of applause', i.e. ‘worthless applause’, like vilia rerum,
strala viarum etc. Then line 7 refers to the prizes of ambition‚
as munera...lnd0s to those of covetousness. But (amlausus is not
a word which lends itself naturally to this genitival construction:
(b) it is not likely that Horace, in asking a question as to the
value to be set upon these things, would imply his own opinion
