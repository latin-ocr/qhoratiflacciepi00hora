208 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

recte petit ‘is right in seeking'.

43—62. One who z's pervim? court to a great man should
abslaz'n from (ι) direct bcggring (43—51)‚ and more indirecl
atlempls lo exta-act money (52—62)‚ ον real causes of complainl
will not mccl witlz attention.

43. sua has sar less authority than su0; but Bentley and
Lachmann (Lucret. p. 238) seem right in preferring the former.
Keller and Schiitz think an epithet is more required with rege,
used in the transferred sense of ‘ patron'‚ than with paupertate,
which can stand alone, the limitafion, which of course is neces-
sary, being then supplied by the context. Cp. Plaut. Stich.
454 lam confido, quam polis, meum me optenturum regem ridi-
culis logis. But it is certainly more pointed to say ‘those who
say nothing before a patron of their own poverty': and the
great probability that sna would be assimilated to rege by tran-
scribers, ianenoed, it may be, by the caesura, outweighs in
this case the MS. evidence.

45. atqui etc. ‘but this was the main point, this the source
of your conduct’: erat not, as Macleane‚ ‘this is the point I
was coming to’3 but ‘the point which we had in view’, in vv.
11, 12, viz. to get as much as possible out of your patron.

46. indotata: to allow a sister to marry without a proper
dowry, was regarded as a great disgrace: cp. Plaut. Trin. 689
ne mz' hanc samam dgffwumt, me germanam meam sororem in
concubinatum tibi si sine dote dem, dedisse magis quam in matri<
monium. quis me improbior perhibeatur esse? haec fangreralio
te honestet, me canlzttnlmtet, si sine dole duxeris.

47. nec vendibffis ‘not saleable' i.e. I can find no pur-
chaser for it: there is no need to suppose, with some editors,
that there was any legal obstacle to the sale.

pascere firmus: another of Homee’s favourite infinitives
after an adjective: cp. Ep. Ι. 15, 30 (note). firmusz‘safe’,
‘ trustworthy ³.

48. succinit ‘chimes in’‚ like another of a troop of beggars,
joining in the cry.

49. ‘et mihil’ It is best with Porphyrion, Keller, Schiitz
and Kriiger to take these words alone, as the cry of the second
beggar. Otherwise the future findetur must be explained as
equivalent to an imperative, which is too strong even sor the
mendici impudentia, which Orelli finds here. Translate ‘the
eake will be divided, and the gift parted between you'. Horace
means ‘ if you beg so shamelessly‚ you will attract the attention
of others, and so you will have to share with them, what other-
wise you might have kept all to yourself'.
