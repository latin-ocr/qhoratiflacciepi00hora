342 ARS POETJCA.

43. lam nunc, ‘ at once’, ‘ at this very time’, Ep. 11. 1,
127, Carm. 11. 1, 17 ; 111. 6, 23: the p10per arrangement is
secured by not saying anything which is not immediately neces-
sary to the clear comprehension of the narrative or the sentiment.
Bentley argues that iam nunc—iam nunc can only mean ‘ at one
time—at another time’‚ quoting Pers. v. 1 10 iam nnnc astringas,
iam nnnc granaria laxes? where it certainly has this meaning.
He therefore takes away the comma after dici. But the sense
which results ‘to say sometimes [everything]‚ and sometimes to
postpone much that ought to be said ⁷, is so poor that we cannot
possibly accept it.

44. pleraque ‘ much' as in Ep. 11. 1, 66 (note) : so plerum-
que ‘ often’ in Ep. 1. 18, 94, and above in v. 14.

differat expresses rather the purpose of the poet, omittat his
action : hence there is no tairtology.

46—45. Bentley first transposed these two lines, so that hoc
—lzoc means ‘ one word—another word’ ; many of the best recent
editors have followed him, and his reasoning seems to be irre-
sistibly cogent. No error is more common in MSS. than the
omission of a verse, which afterwards is restored to a wrong
place: and lzoc—lzoc seems almost inexplicable, if referred to the
topic of order. It is extremely otiose to say that the composer of
a poem long promised is to make a selection of his subject-
matter. Schiitz attempts to defend the traditional order, but
with little success His argument that derat, dffrat and omz'ltat
need auctor as a subject is not strong: the subject is easily
supplied from lzmzc of v. 41 : and the change to the second per-
son dareris is not harsh, and does not require the introduction of
a new theme.

45—59. Famz'lz'ar words acquirefi-eslzness in a new connexion ;
and new words may be coium? with discretion.

46. tenuis, here a word of praise, not blame=subtz‘le's,
λεπτός. Cp. Carm. 11. 16, 38 spiritum Graiae tenuem Camenae.

serendis ‘connecting‘, suggesting both the avoidance of
hiatus, and awkward juxtaposition‚ and also fresh syntaetic com-
binations.

47. camde- 1unctura: Orelli quotes as instances from Horace
himself splendide mendax, insaniens& sapientiae consulms,
animae magnae prodigus. Prof. Nettleship happily refers to the
charge brought against Vergil by Agrippa that he had been
suborned by Maecenas to invent a new kind of affectation, which
consisted in an unusual employment of ordinary words, and was
therefore difficult of detection (Sueton. XLIV. novae cacozeliae
