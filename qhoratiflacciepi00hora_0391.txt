variations in the legend cp. Dict. Biog. s.v. Sophocles in his
Peleus seems to have represented him as expelled by Archander
and Architeles sons of Acastus (Frag. 434—442 D.)‚ Euripides as
banished by Acastus (Frag. 620—626 D.). But as Isocr. Evag.
192 b speaks of him as κατὰ πολλοὺς ἄλλους κινδύνους εὐδοκιμήσας,
we cannot say what part of his lise of varied adventure was
especially in the mind of Horace.

spite of the arguments of Prof. J. B. Mayor in Cic. de Nat. l).

ampullas, Ep. Ι. 3, 14 (notelz sesquipedalia, polysyllable5‚
such as those much in favour with the early Latin dramatists.
Gellius XIX. 7 quotes from Laevius jbcdz'fiugus, pudone-olor,
trzkaeclisenex, dulcioriloquus and others. Pacuvius wrote Nerei
repandz'rostrum z'ncurvc'ccrm‘cum pecus. Crates (quoted by Athen.
X. 418 C) speaks of ἔπη τριπήχη Θετταλικῶς τετμημένα, i.e. cut
into big pieceS, such as the Thessalian gluttons loved.

98ι si. curat cor: the neglect of the caesura is intentional,
to imitate the carelessness of artistic form in one feeling deeply.
Cp. Pers. 1. 91 qni me volet z'ncum'asse querella ; and sor the
perf. infin. Ep. Ι. 17, 5 note. The evidence of the best MSS. iu
Horace (cp. Keller Epil. on Carni. ΙΙ. 9, 18). in Vergil (Ribbeck, ·
Proll. 429) and Ovid (Merkel, Praef. ΙΙ. p. viii.)‚ is uniformly in
favour of querella, not quercla. Cp. Lachmann on Lucret.

defends querela on the authority of the grarnniarians.

99. pulchra ‘ fine’ when judged by the canons of art τ dulcia
‘charming' to th'e feelings and hearts os the readers. Gesner
quotes the French saying ε La beant& est pour l'esprit, la domem·
est pour le coeur. Bentley's conjecturepmzz is unfortunate. He
shows with his usual learning that pura verba denotes plain,
simple language (cp. Sat. Ι. 4, 54), but does not prove that pulchra
is here out of place. On the contrary his quotations from Sat. 1.
10, 6 and Ep. 11. 1, 72 bear out the meaning here assigned
to it.

101. adsunt (or assunt, Roby 1. p. 49 note) is the reading
of the MSS. supported by Acron’s ‘in praesto sunt’. Bentley
eagerly accepted what some earlier scholars had suggested,
adstent, supporting it by a quotation of some anonyinous gramma-
rian, doubtless made from meinory. But the three-sold repeti-
tion of flcre would be sar from elegant, and the antithesis would
be disagreeably forced, with this reading. For adesse ‘to support'
with help and sympathy cp. v. 204, Ep. 1. 17, 57: so often in
Cic. and Livy. Halm reads in Tac. Hist. 111. 55 vulgus adera!
(MS. haberat) in the sense of ‘responded to ².
