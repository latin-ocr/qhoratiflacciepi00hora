earliest stages of the language. It is difficult to find this in the
text3 Pope’s imitation is based upon a similar interpretation
(⁶ For use will father what’s begot by sense ’). The fact is that
Horace is not speaking here of coming new terms, so much as
adopting and so stamping with his sanction those which have
but lately become current, and are not yet recognized as classical.
Hence adsciscet which is used of admitting-strangers to the
franchise, or recruits into a legion. It is impossible to resist the
soree of the parallel passage in A. Ρ. 70—72‚ or we might be
tempted to give to usus the soree of ⁶ his needs', as in Sat. 1. 3,
102 armis, quae post fizbricaverat usus.

‘New phrases, in the world of books unknown,
So use but father them, he makes his own.' Con.

120. vemens: cp. note on v. 28. The poet must have the
swift strong rush of a sull stream, without losing clearness and
purity of style. Cicero Brut. 79, 274 says of Μ. Calidius: pn·-
mum ita pura erat [orati0], ut mlul lzqul'mlms zla lzbmeflucbat,
ut nusquam adlzaet esm et.

121. beabit, a favourite word with Horace (Ep. Ι. 18, 75;
Carm. Π. 3, 7, lv. 8, 29), but not osten used elsewhere, except
in the comic poets. It may perhaps be reckoned (as by NValz)
among his archaisms.

122. luxuriantia, sc. verba, of a redundancy in style, com-
pared to the rank growth of trees not duly pruned. The meta-
phorical reference is confirmed, not, as Schiitz thinl S, (lisprov ed
by compesce& cp. Verg. Georg. 11. 370 lamas compescefluenlzs:

sano, i.e. one which does not emasculate: cp. A. P. 26.

123. virtute, not ‘merit’‚ but rather ‘energy, vigour'.
The other saults can be set right: this admits of nothing but
complete excision.

‘But show no mercy to an empty line ’. Pope.

Orelli, overlooking this, thinks that there would be a tautology
after compescet, and would translate tollet ‘will raise'‚ i.e. add
force to. His first quotation srom Quintilian is garbled: sor the
second, 1V. 2, 61 snpra modum se tollens oratio would have been
more to the point. But it is not likely that Horace would h‘ave
used a term so likely to be misunderstood. Cp. Plaut. Asin.
783 ergo, m‘ iubes, tollam, i.e. ‘1 will strike it out'. The codd.
Bland. and some other MSS. have calentia. To defend this, and
interpret lollet of a father ‘tanquam infantem natum, ut nutriat
educatque’ is the blindest partisanship.
