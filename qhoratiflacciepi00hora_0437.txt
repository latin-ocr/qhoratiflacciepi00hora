fourth conjugation, and hence with ῑ, except scitari, Roby ἓ 964.
The Greek grammarians and philosophers delighted to discover
inconsistencies and errors in Homer, most of all Zoilus, known
as Ὀμηρομάστιξ. Lucilius (vv. 439—442 Lachm.) censured the
extravagance of the story of Polyphemus. Ribbeck, holding
that the current text gives just the wrong meaning, reads in-
digner with„ a mark of interrogation at Homerus, and at idem
for et idem. This is attractive; sor the ordinary reading seems
to be quite inconsistent with vv. 351—2: if Horace is not
offended by a few faults, why should he be indignant at occa-
sional nodding? But in this somewhat loose writing Horace
appears to have shisted his point of view. ‘If a poet commits
but few faults, these can be overlooked. Ifhe is always blunder-
ing, we ridicule him, even when to our astonishment he occa-
sionally goes right. But if he is to be judged by a higher stand-
ard, then he must expect us to be annoyed at his slips. But
aster all he ought to be pardoned even sor thern, if his task is a
long one.’ So the vulgate may be allowed to stand.

360. operi longo: so the large majority of good MSS.
Some have opere in longo, which would have required fuit.-
besides the personification of the work is pleasing rather than
otherwise, though Ribbeck holds that Bentley has by no means
proved that a work can sleep.

361. ut. pictura poesis. The comparison of a painting to
a picture was made by Simonides: ό Σιμωνίδης τὴν μὲν ζωγρα-
φίαν ποίησιν σιωπῶσαν προσαγορεύει, τὴν δὲ ποίησιν ζωγραφίαν
λαλοῦσαν (Plut. de glor. Ath. 3), repeated in ad Herenn. 1v. 28,
39 poema loquens piclnra, pictura tacitum poema debet esse. The
misleading character of this utterance of ‘the Greek Voltaire’
Lessing has brought out well in the Vorrede to his Laocoon.
But here, as Orelli well points out, the reference is only to the
external aspects of the two kinds of art, not to their points of
internal resemblance.

362. austes: a ἀπ. λεγ. Keller thinks that the reading
aples of the good MS. B points to the spelling apslcs.

364. arg-utum acumen: Reid on Cic. Acad. Ι. 2, 7 points
out how often argute is joined with acute in Cic.
