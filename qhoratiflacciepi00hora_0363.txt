sive—an ratus: XIV. 59 sz’ve—seu—an, and to their complete
confusion iu later Latin : cp. Drager Hz'st. Synt. 11. 466.

201. 11011 agimur, concessive, ‘we are not driven on, it is
true’: cp. Ep. 1. r, 333 6, 29.

aquilone seeundo: the strong north wind, even if favour-
able, might swell the sails to a dangerous extent: hence
it is here used of perilous prosperity. The aquilo is clarus in
Verg. G. 1. 460, and in G. 111. 196, 7 scatters ‘the arida nubila,
while it is siccus in Lucan 1V. 50. Elsewhere it brings storms
and snow, but rarely rain: hence the derivation from aqua is to
be rejected without hesitation, in favour of that from aquilus

‘dark’ (Vanibek, p. 13). Cp. Carm. ΙΙ. 10, 23 contrahes vento
nimium secundo turgida vela.

202. aetatem ducimus ‘we drag out our life’. Epod.
17, 6 3 ingrata misero vita ducenda est. austris: the south wind
is usually regarded as stormy (turbidus, Cat-m. 111. 3, 4), rainy
(umidus, Verg. G. Ι. 462, pluvius, Ov. Met. 1. 66), and cold
(frigidus, Verg. G. IV. 261, hibernus, Tib. 1. 1, 47): cp. Verg.
Aen. V. 696 imber...densz'sque nzgrerrz'mus austris. But cp. Verg-
111. 60, v. 764.

203. virtute: SchUtz, who renders ‘excellent capacities',
and denies that a man can have too much virtue, has forgotten
Ep. 1. 6, 15—16.' 1000, ‘position’.

204. extremi ...priorem cp. Ep. 1. 2, 70—71. usque,
‘ever’; A. P. 154, 354 and often.

205. 11011 es: again concessive. Horace is not addressing
Florus, but any reader; cp. Ep. 1, 1, 28. abi. ‘very good’‚ a
colloquial use: cp. Plaut. Asin. 704 em sic: abi, laudo: Ter.
Adelph. 564 laudo: Ctesipho, patrissas: abi, virum le iudico.

206. fugere: the codd. Bland. and other good MSS. have
ficge: rite caret which Bentley in his Curae novissimae (11. p.
172 Zang.) approves in the form fuge rite. Caret, etc. But
there is at least as much authority sor the text, which seems to
have been altered only because the copyists did not understand
the perfect tense, or, perhaps, as Keller thinks, from a mis-
understood correction of an unmetrical ficgerunt.
