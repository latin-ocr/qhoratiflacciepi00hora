anquatribus‚ the ‘spring holidays'‚ which were observed
not only in schools, but as general festivities, from March 19
to March 23. Ovid (Fast. 111. 809, 810 fiunt sacra Alincrvae,
nomina quae zunctz's quinque diebus habent) derives the name
from the fact that the holiday extended over five days: but
Festus (p. 254 M.), by quoting forms like Triatrus, Sexatrus,
etc. shows that the word was applied originally only to the
first day of the festival, and that it denotes the fifth day after
the Ides. Cp. Mayor on Juv. X. 115 totis Quinquatribus optat.

199. domus. Bentley attacked this reading, as inconsistent
with the metaphor of a ship in the next line. One MS. of no
great excellence repeats procul which Bentley gladly accepted.
ssut this repetition, though common enough in passages of earnest
and impressive diction (eg. Verg. Aen. VI. 258 procul o procul
vste prtffimz‘: Ov. Fast. 11. 623, Metam. V111. 589 etc.) is not
well suited to the quiet tone of Horace here. Some MSS. of
the third class omit domus and absit (not, as Bentley supposed,
domus only): but this is clearly due to an accident, and does
not justify the suspicion of Orelli and others that the genuine
word has been lost, and that domus is due only to conjecture.
Meineke approved the conjecture modo, but in Horace we
always find ηιὸιίὸ, and that only after dum or si. This difficulty
is avoided by Jeep’s conjecture, adopted by Kriiger, modo ut
procul. No satisfactory substitute for domus has been proposed,
and the word is in itself not indefensible, although Maeleane
says ‘it has no meaning here’. There is nothing metaphorica]
in this line, and consequently no clashing of metaphors. We
may fairly assume, with Ritter, that pauperies immunda domm
represents pauperies immmzdae domus (cp. Carm. ΙΙΙ. Ι, 42):
Horace goes back in thought to the costly ornaments of the
house mentioned in vv. 180—182‚ and says that all these may
well be spared: provided the struitened means are not such as
to produce sordid surroundings‚ a man's lodging makes no
inore difference to himself than the size of a ship would, in
which he might happen to be sailing.

utrum—an. This is at first sight a startling substitution of
the dependent double interrogatixe for the alternative hypo-
thesis szve— szz e. But it is to t>be explained by supposing that
some expression like nilnl distat was present to the mind of
Horace, for which he afteru ards substituted ferar nnus et idem.
Hand (Tursell. 1. 302) quotes Ov. Rern. Am. 797 Daunius an
Libycis bulbus tibi missus ab oris, an veniat Megaris, noxius
omnis erit, where the explanation is similar. In Fast. 111. 779
Ovid uses an as parallel to sive...sz‘ve, where we have a transition
from alternative hypotheses to a direct question. This leads
the way to the interchange of the two, as in Tac. Ann. X1. 26
