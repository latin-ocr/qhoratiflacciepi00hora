320 HORATI EPISTULAE.

Towards the end of the reign of Augustus a lllum'cz'pium Au-
gustum Veiens was established on the old site, and continued to
exist at least sor three or four centuries. lsola Farnese does not,
as Orelli says, mark the site of Veii, but is separated from it by
a deep ravine. Cp. Dennis, Cz'ties and Cemeleries of Etruria
l2 1—42. For Aricia cp. Sat. 1. 5, 1.

163. emptum is the emphatic word: ‘if a man has bought
land of old...the vegetables on which he dines are bought:
bought too are the logs’, etc.

169. sub noctem gives an instance where ‘towards' is a
better rendering than ‘just aster': ‘as the chill of night comes
on’. Cp. Sat. 11. 1, 93 7, 1093 Epod. 11. 44. Verg. Georg. 1.
¹21 1 usque sub extremmn brumae intractabilis imbrem.

170. suum, i. e. ‘he calls all (the land) his own': usque...
qua ‘as far as the spot where': adsita not simply ‘planted',
as Servius explains in Verg. Aen. Vr. 603, acl being virtually
redundant, as in adsimilis. The word is used in Varro R. R. 1.
¹6 and 26 sor ‘planted near': vilis adsita ad holus. An old
grammarian (Agroec. p. ‘2274 P.) explains adsita arbor est, cui
incolumi allud quod sustineat adiungitur. Horatius ‘qua popu-
lus adsita snrgit’, quippe qni vitibus maritata sz't. But this
meaning is, when found, only derived from the context, as in
Catuli. LXI. 102, velut azlsz'las vitis implicat arbores; and is here
out of place. The poplar is here not used for the support of
vines, but only to mark the boundaries, as the beeches in Verg.

171. limitibus The limz'tc‘s were properly strips or balks
of land, lest uncultivated in order to mark the boundaries of
estates and used as highways. Niebuhr Hz'st. Rern. Vol. 11.‚
App. 1. and ΙΙ. describes very fully the Roman practice of limi-
tatio: the use of the word limes is also admirably discussed by
Dr Hort in Caml). Joztrn. ο] Phil. for 1857, p. 350 ff. in ex-
plaining Tac. Ann. Ι. 50 limitem scindzt. The case may be
either dative or ablative of place. Schiitz less probably takes it
as an ablative of instrument: but the limiles were cerli before

the tree was planted. Cp. Verg. Aen. XII. 898 (saxum) limes

refugit: both the word and the tense have caused much diffi-
culty to the critics. Bentley adopts the reading of sorne inferior
MSS. refigd, which he takes as equivalent to resolvit, without
however supporting the meaning by any parallel instance,
Others have suggested raflzgri4 refutat, or reffl'iQ'ff: the last
of which is the best, is any conjecture is needed. But it is not
too bold a metaphor to speak of the tree as itsels avoiding the
