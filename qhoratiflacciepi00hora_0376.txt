me the more correct ’. But 1 cannot but think that Ritter,
Kriiger and Schiitz are right in desending imus. It is not
necessary to accept Porph-'s explanation ‘ hoc est, in angulo
ludi tabernam habentem’ though it may well be founded on a
genuine tradition, as the details which he adds (see below) are
not likely to be mere inventi0n3 while Acron’s interpretation of
the word as a proper name is the last refuge of a despairing
commentator. But Ι (10 not see why imus should not have the
natural soree of ‘the lowest in rank', i. e. the poorest‚ or most
unskilful. Bentley had of course no difficulty in showing that
unus is often used of preeminent excellence (cp. Sat. 1. 10, 423
11. 3, 243 6, 57); but why is it necessary to suppose that Horace
had in view a particular crastsman, who was distinguished sor
his skill in details, but failed in his works as a whole? It is
surely legitimate to say ‘the poorest smith who lives by the Aemi-
lian school will represent you nails, and imitate waving hair in
bronze’: and if so, there is no reason to depart from the MSS.
Jordan (Hermes, Vol. lx. 416 fs.) shows that probably around
the outer walls of the ludus there were tabernae, let out to fabri
by the builder or lessee of the school: he thinks that the last of
these facing the main street was tenanted by the faber in ques-
tion under the sign of a figure of Polycletus, which gave rise to
the name by which (according to Porph.) the ludus was after-
wards known, when turned into a bath (quod nunc Polycletz
balineum est). If it is not legitimate to take the expression as a
general one, and some particular craftsman is denoted, this view
seems defensible.

‘Fix on some casual sculptor, he shall know
How to give nails their sharpness, hair its flow'. Con.

Orelli seems wrong in regarding elaborate accuracy in the re·
presentation of the hair as a great merit in a sculptor. After
the path had once been pointed out (according to Pliny N. H.
XXXIV. 8, 19 by Pythagoras of Rhegium: but cp. Overbeck,
Gesch. d. Grieclz. Plastz'k, p. 183), it was not hard to follow it.

33. mollis ‘waving’‚ as often in Vergil, e.g. Ecl. 111. 45
molli acantho, applied to hair by Tibull. Ι. 8, 9 quid tibi nunc
mollis prodest coluisse capillos ,Ρ

34. infelix operis summa ‘ failing in his work as a whole ἐ
summa may be best taken as the ablative of the part concerned
(Roby ἓ 1210, S. G. ἓ 497): Bentley puts a comma aster operis,
which is then the genitive of the part concerned (Roby§ 1320,
S. G. ἓ 526), a construction which is legitimate enough in itsels‚
but here leaves summa to stand by itself very awkwardly.

ponere ‘represent'‚ often used of plastic art, as in Carm. IV.
8, 8 sollei's nunc hominem ponere, nnnc deum: so componere in
the next ine.
