144 ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE.

71 sine crimine coniunx, Cic. de Orat. 1. 23, 105 loquacitatem
sine usu (note).

notum properare ‘well known for working with energy’:
for the construction cp. Sil. Ital. XII. 330 Delius avertet pro-
piora pericula vates T rm'cznos nolus semper minuisse labores.
This is an instance of Horace's free use of the infinitive (cp.
Ritter on Carni. Ι. 1, 18 οι· Wickham's Appendix 11.) and is
better than Orelli's interpretation, which places a comma after
nolum and takes it absolutely. Bentley inclines, though with
doubt, to the reading sine crimine natum, but, besides having
very slight MS. support, this is ill suited to a sreedman sine
palma—loco ‘at the right time', not quite (as Yonge) ὅταν τύχῃ,
but rathgr ἐν καιρῷ. Cp. Carm. IV. 12, 28, Ter. Ad. 216, Roby
ἓ 1172, . G. 5488.

cessare ‘taking holiday’: cessare otiari et iucunde vivere
Comm. Cruq. Ep. 1. 10, 46, 11. 2, 183 &c-

58. parvis ‘humble’ like himself.—-1are certo ‘a house of
his own’3 he is not like Maenius in Ep. 1. 15, 28. Bentley's
suggestion curlo would be redundant aster tenui censu.

59. ludis: sc. scaenicis et circensibus: these were held only
on days of general holiday, so the limitation post decisa negotia
is not needed in this case.

campo, sc. Martio: Carm. Ι. 8, 4, Sat. ΙΙ. 6, 49, Ep. 1.
Π, 4. The usual time sor exercise in the campus was the eighth
hour: the ainuseinents there practised were running, jumping,
wrestling, boxing, spear-throwing, riding, swimming in the
Tiber‚ and ball playing.

60. scitari, a good instance of the reflexive deponent ‘to
make niyself infor-ined', Roby, ἓ 734, 1419: the word is not
used in good prose.

61. non sanezot’a πάνυ, but in both cases the question has
been raised whether the negative is strengthened or weakened
hythe added particle. The former seems to be the case: cp.
Cope⁷s Gorgias App. ii., Cic. de Orat. 11. 1, 5 (note), de Off.
ΙΙ. 2, 5 hand sane inlellego: Ep. ΙΙ. 1, 106, Sat. ΙΙ. 3, 158. Hence
we must reject Orelli's vix as an equivalent.

62. benigne: cp. v. 16.

63. neget, ‘is he to resuse me?' Roby S. G. ἓ 674.
improbus ‘the impudent sellow', stom the point of view of
Demetrius. We need not, with Orelli, try to weaken the force
of the epithet by referring to our colloquial use of words like
‘wretch ⁷, or ‘ rascal'.

64. mane, ‘next morning '.
