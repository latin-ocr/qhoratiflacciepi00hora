times: cp. Mart. IV. 8, 1 prima salutantes alque altera conterit
lzora.

8. laedit: most MSS. have laedet, which is only a careless
assimilation to imma—Ferentinum, a lonely place in the Ilei-ni-
can country, according to the Schol. Cruq. nnmlczspium viae Labi-
canae cul xlviii lapidem. The town is osten mentioned by Livy:
Horace evidently speaks of it as a proverbially quiet place,
although the extant remains show that it was a considerable
town. There is no mention os it in history after B.C. 21 1, so that
it may have been a decaying place in the time of Horace. It
must be distinguished both from an Etruscan town of the same
name (Tae) Hist. 11. 50) which some however have supposed to
be intended here, and from the &reatinae lucus (Liv. 1. 50), ml
caput Ferentinum (Liv. 11. 38) which was at Marino, near Alba
Longa. Cp. Dict. Geogr.

10. fefeuit ‘has passed ιιῃηοῒίεεᾶέλέληθεν. Cp. Ep. 1.
18, 103. The word is used with an accusative of the person iu
Carm. 111. 16, 32, and Epod. 111. 7, without one in Liv. XXII. 33,
1 speculator Carllmgl'niensium, qui per biennium flyi’llcrat,
Romae deprehensus, who often has it in both constructions: cp.
Fabri on Liv. XXI. 48, 5. Ovid's line (Trist. 111. 4, ²5) crede
milzz' bene qui latuit, bene vixit has become proverbial: both
Horace and he seem to have borrowed the thought from the
saying ascribed to Epicurus λάθε βιώσας, criticized by Plutarch
in his treatise εἰ καλῶς εἴρηται τὸ λάθε βιώσας.

11. prodesse tuis: cp. v. 46, which can hardly however
have a direct reference to Scaeva, as Schiitz supposes.

12. · siccus, not quite, as in Ep. ῐ. 19, 9, Carm. Ι. 18, 3, IV,
5, 39, Sat. 11. 3, 281, ‘sober'‚ but rather ‘hungry' as in Sat. 11.
2, 143 cp.saztcz'bus siccis of hungry wolves in Verg. Aen. 11. 388.
Macleane’s quotation of ἐπὶ ξηρυῖσι from Theocr. 1. 51 is not
really parallel. -

ad unctum: Comm. Cruq. explains ‘pauper et tenuis ad
opulentum et locupletem’‚ and this view has found much sup-
port. But it is very doubtful whether in any of the passages
where unctus is applied to persons, it can have this force. On
the other hand unclum is used several times sor ‘a rich meal’:
cp. A. P. 422, and Pers. VI. 16 cenare sine uncto: so Ep. 1. 15,
44 melius et unctius. Hence it is better to take the word here
too as a neuter.
