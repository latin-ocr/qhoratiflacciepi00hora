Bk. Ι. Ep. XVII.] NOTES. 207

Cp. Carm. 111. 2, 21 virtus recludens imum-ilis mori caelum
negata temptat iter via.

36. non cuivis etc. ‘it is not the lot os every one to be
able to visit Corinth: i. e. every one has not the means to
indulge m the pleasures provided so abundantly, but at so hi‹ rh
a price, at Corinth. According to the testinyiony of Gellius
(1. 8, 4), Strabo (V.111 6, 20), the scholiasts her,e and the Greek
paroemia<s σ’,ναρΙιι the proverb οὑ παντὸς ἀνδρὸς ἐς Κόρινθον ἕσθό “
πλοῦς originated in the exorbitant demands made by Lais and
other notorious courtesans of the place, on those who sought
their favours. But the context shows that this origin had been
almost if not entirely forgotten‚ or Horace could not have used
it thus of the prizes due to preeminent virtue. Still less can
there be any reference, as Erasmus aster Suidas thought, to the
dangerous entrance to the harbour. The old notion that con-
tingere was only used of good fortune has long been discarded.
Cp. note on Cic. Cat. 1. 7, 16, Mayor on Phil. 11. ,17,1κεί(1 on
Lael. 2, 8.

37. sedit ‘ renounces the attempt’3 like καθῆσθαι of remain-
ing inactive. Cp. Ter. Ad. 672 an sedere aporlnd <imni tam
grandem virginem, where Donatus remarks ‘sedere proprie
ignavae cessationis est': Verg. Georg. 111. 455 meliora deos
sedet omina poscens. Cic. Sest. 15, 34 isdem consulibus sedentibus
(Holden). Mr Reid thinks however that the contrast with
pervenit requires that sedit should have rather the meaning
‘takes a low place ' z a force common enough in the literal sense,
as in Lucret. V. 474 ‹ltpressa sederent. The persects are
‘gnomic ³, as in Ep. 1. 2, 48 (note), A.P. 343.

11011 succederet, impersonally ‘things should not goweH
with him': as in Ter. Andr. 670 hac non successit ; alia αιζςντ-
dz‘emur via. Sometimes succedo is used with res, or inceptum, as
the subject, but ,apparently never like our ‘succeed² with a
persor}3 as the nominative. For this, procedere may be used, eg.
Sall. at. Ι.

esto ‘ very good ⁷ : cp. Ep. Ι. 81 (note).

38. fecitne = nonne fecit, as so often in Plautus and
Terence. So meministine in Cic. Cat. Ι. 3, 7.

39. hic, i.e. in the answer which we give to this question.

quod. quaerimus: cp. Reid on Cic. Lael. 18, 65, de Fin. 111.
8, 29, v. 12, 34.

42. experiens ‘enterprising’z Cic. pro Cluent. 8. 23, A.
Aurzus vir scutis et expen'ens: in Verr. 111. 21, 53 homo navus
et industrms, expen‘entisszmus [ac diali ιεἶ’ἰνιίιω-ιηιιις] α) ator.
