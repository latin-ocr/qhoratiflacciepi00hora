found in it a serious censure.

EPISTLE IX.

Septimius, on whose behalf this charming letter of introduc-
tion was addressed to Tiberius Claudius, was undoubtedly the
friend who is greeted with so much affection in Carm. 11. 6.
The Comm. Cruqz says that his name was Titius Septimius, and
identifies him with the Titius of Ep. 1. 3, 9. This is highly im-
probable, for the combination of two gentile names was at this
time unknown. There is no other reason, besides this assumed
idendty, to suppose that the occasion of this letter was the expe—
dition of Tiberius to the East; and the omission of the name of
Septimius in Ep. 1. 3 makes it improbable; domo (v. 4) ancl
gregis (v. 13) point rather to an introduction of the usual kind.
There is nothing to determine the date, except that it is likely
to have been before rather than after B.C. 20.
