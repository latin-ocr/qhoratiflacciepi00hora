108 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

Augustus until A.D. 3, after the death of his grand-children
Gaius and Lucius Caesar, the sons of Julia.

laboro, stronger than cupio: Sat. 11. 8, 19 nosse laboro.

3. Thraca, a poetical form (=Opqltcn) used also Ep. 1. 16, 13
and by Verg. Aen. XII. 335. Ribbeck and Kennedy there read
Thraeca, and Keller here with one MS. has Tin-cca: the latter
cannot well be right. Cp. Fleckeisen Fz'lnszzgr Artz'kel‚ p. 30.
Servius on Verg. l. c. says that Cicero used mmmm in the de
Rep., but the MS. (11. 4, 9) has the later form 772racz'am: cp.
Lachmann on Lucr. V. 30, Ellis on Catullus, lv. 8. In the Odes
(11. 16, 5, 111. 25, 11) Horace according to his custom uses the
Greek form Thrace, so does Ovid, Fast. v. 25 7, Pont. lv. 5, 5.

Hebrus, proverbially cold: Carm. 1. 25, 20; Ep. 1. 16, 13.
Dr Schmitz in Dict. Geogr. says it is still sometimes frozen over.
The snow osten lies thick on the Balkans in winter, but I can find
no other modern authority sor the sreezing of the Hebrus any
more than the Danube, which was frozen in the days of Ovid's
banishment (Trist. 111. 10, 31—2).

4. freta, the Hellespont: currentia3 in consequence of the
large rivers which flow into the Euxine, there is always a strong
current outwards in the Hellespont. Cf. Lucret. V. 507, where
Munro quotes Shakspere's Othello 111. 3, ‘like to tlte Pontis sea,
whose icy current and compulsive course ne’er ftels retirz'ng ebb,
but keeps due on to tlte Propontz'c and tlze Hellespont) turres of
Sestos and Abydos. The tower of Hero at Sestos is often
mentioned, and Strabo XIII. 22, speaks of πύργον τινά κατ’
ἀντικρὺ τῆς Σηστοῦ, (in Lucan IX. 955 Heroas lacrimoso litore
turres, the plural seems to be merely a poetical variation)‚ but
we need not seek for authority for so natural a phrase. Bentley
adopts terras from the Bland. vet. : this seems to be one of the
numerous instances in which that MS. bears the mark of an
ingenious critical recension, rather than a genuine tradition.
Cp. Introd.

6—20. Tell me too what z‘s being written byyou. Who z's
attempting history? ls T z'tz'us stz'll writing Oetes. or trying bis
hamt at tragedy? Does Celsus remember tlte warnz'ngs he llas
received to be more orzginal in lzz's poa'lly ?

6. cohors ‘suite’. Mommsen (Hermes IV. 120 ff.) writes
‘ comites are the attendants selected by the Emperor for a parti-
cular journey, amici the persons admitted by the Emperor at
a reception, especially his more intimate acquaintances. Thus
every comes is an amicus, but by no means every amicus also
a comes—Cohors amicorum = comites expeditionis cuiusdam. —The
political suite of the Emperor on a journey are generally described
