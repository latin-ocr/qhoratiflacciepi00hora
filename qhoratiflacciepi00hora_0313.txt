Miiller, Addend. p. 303) : but Bergk's view that Fabius is not a
poet at all, but a learned lawyer (Ritschh Parerg. Praef. xnl.)
is quite consistent with the context in Pliny (cp. ib. p. ¹05)-
Finally Senec. Ep. LXXXIX. 6 quotes an inscription on the tonib
of Dossennus ‘hospes resz'sle ct sophiam Dossenni legc’, a quota·
tion which certainly raiscs more difficulties than it removes.

The view taken by Ritschl of this passage can hardly be
said to be certain, in sace of the corrupt state of our scanty
authorities; but it is at least more plausible than any other
interpretation as yet put sot-ward. Orelli ignores it, Sch'utz
disputes it, but Ritter‚ Dillenb'tirger and (with more hesitation)
Kriiger accept it.

1⁹14. quam non adstricto socco ‘with how loose a sock’:
the soccus (κρηπίς) or ‘slipper' of comedy is contrasted with the
cothurnus (κόθορνος) or ⁴ buskin' of tragedy in A. P. 80. Cp.
Milton's ‘ IfJonson's learned sock be on’.

175. loculos, properly any sort osa casket or satchel (cp.
Ep. 1. 1, 56), used of a purse or money-box, also in Sat. 1. 3,

The charge here brought against Plautus ‘may very probably be
true, and is by no means to his discredit ’ (sellan Roman Poels,
p. 164: the context is well worth reading). 'l'he play-wright sold
his play to the magistrate who gave the shows at which they
were acted. Terence is said to have received 8000 sesterces for
his Eunuchus, more than any play had produced before.

176. cadat ‘ fails', sor which Aristotle uses ἐκπίπτειν (Poet.
17, 13 18‚5; 20, 5).

stet ‘holds its own ’‚ i. e. succeeds: cp. Ter. Hecyr. 15

magnus orator. . .si semel constiterit, nunquam cadet.

recto talo ‘ steadily ⁷ ; borrowed srom the Greek, e. g. Pind.
Isthm. VI. 12 ὀρθῷ ἔστασας ἐπὶ σφυρῷ, and imitated by Pers. v.
104 recto vivere talo. ‘ This criticism is to a great extent true’‚
Sellar l.c. Not that Plautus was without a natural pridein the
success os some of his plays, but ‘ his delight was that of a vigor-
ous creator, not of a painstaking artist '.
