156 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

only from Cato (three times) and an inscription—which has led
to the reading ponendaque in the vet. Bland„ although Neue
thinks the ablative may possibly be defended by Tac. Ann. 111.
19 is finis fuit ulciscenda Germanici morte, XIV. 4 prosequitur
abezmtcm artius oculis et pectori haerens, sive explenda simula-
tione sen etc. Buththis construction is too unnatural to be forced
upon Horace without overwhelming authority, which there cer-
tainly is not here. The thought is compressed, and, if expanded,
would run somewhat thus, ‘and if the first thing to be done is to
choose the suitable sphere, as you would first choose the site if
you were building a house'.

15. tepeant3 of course the winters are not milder in the
country than in town; but Horace is thinking of his own country-
house, sheltered by hills from the colder winds.

16. rabiem Canis: the dog-star rises on July aoth, but

becomes visible only on July 26th. The sun enters the constel-
lation Leo on July 23rd.

momenta: perhaps best taken as in Ep. 1. 6, 4 of ‘motions',
i.e. ‘the celestial movements which bring the Sun near to the
Lion, which his keen rays are represented as stinging into a
sury, thus causing intense heat. Others translate ‘time' during
which Leo is passing, ‘influence ’ ot· ‘attacks'. Conington renders
‘Or when the Lion seels in every vein, The sun’s sharp thrill,
and maddens with the pain’. Momentum means sometimes a
motion, sometimes a moving force.

18. diveuatzabrumpat. This is better than the v. 1. de-
pellat, both as better supported on the whole, and as a less
obvious reading. Cp. Verg. G. 111. 530 somnos abrumpit cura .-
Ov. Am. 11. 10, 19 amor somnos abrumpat.

19. olet: the mosaic pzwements, so well known to us from
the remains of Roman villas (cp. Becker Gallus 11. 245—251)‚
were often sprinkled with persumes. Libycis; the Numidian
marble is often mentioned: e. g. Carm. 11. 18, 4: cp. Plin.
H. N. xxxv1. 8, 6.

lapillis: 2000 distinct pieces of coloured marble have been
counted in a single square foot of one of the mosaics at Pompeii

(Becker p. 249).

20. vicis ‘quarters' or ‘streets' of the city. plumbum: in
the time of Horace water was brought into Rome by five or six
large aqueducts (afterwards increased to sourteen)‚ each supply-
ing one large reservoir (castellnm). Sometimes leaden pipes
<fistulae or tubuli) were used instead of or within the water-
channel (specus) of the aqueduct3 but more commonly they were
employed to distribute the water from the castellum to the public
