Bk. I. Ep. VIL] NOTES. 143

50. adrasum: all Keller’s MSS. have this form, not abra-
sum, which is not only badly supported but incorrect‚ for homo
adraditnr, barba abraditur .· ad is here intensive (Roby, ξ 1834,
S. G. ἓ 801) ‘closely shaven’, but as a man who has just been
shaven is closely shaven, we may take it, if we please, here
as= recens rasum with Orelli, without seeking (with Yonge)
for any precise parallel. The word seems to apply to the bea1d
only, not, as some take it, to the head, compating Ep. Ι. 18,
where the connexion is quite different.

umbra, ‘booth ', as in Greek σκιά for σκηνή. The booth
was empty, because the busier custotners had been trimlned
earlier in the day3 the man was sitting, leisurely paring his own
nails, a duty generally undertaken by the barber (cp. Plaut.
Aul. 310 quin ipse pridem tonsor unguis dempserat, collegit,
omnia abstulit praesegmina, Mart. ΙΙΙ. 74), and his comfortable
repose attracted the interest of Philippus. There is nothing
to show (as Macleane supposes) that ‘he was jealous, and
resolved to spoil his independence, if he could ἐ v. 74 certainly
does not prove this.

52. non laevezofi σκαιῶςε the adverbia] form is not found
elsewhere. Demetrius was the usual pedisequus of Philippus.

53. unde domo, ‘where he comes srom'. Cp. Verg. V111.
114 unde d0mo=⁷r60w οἰκόθεν. Orelli says the word is fre-
quently used in inscriptions to denote the town from which a
man comes.

54. quove patrono: a freedman had no father, in the eyes
of the law, but his place was taken to a certain extent by his
patronus. In the account brought back by Demetrius the men-
tion of the name Menas (a Greek name contracted froin lllenodo-
rus, like Hermas for Hermodorus, Demas for Demodorus (?) etc.
cp. Moulton's Winer p. 128, Lightfoot on Coloss. IV. 12, 15)
suffieed to show that he was a freedman3 hence no further
answer is given to this question, for Velleius must have been his
patron.

55. Volteium : several of this gens are mentioned in history.
and the name occurs on a Pompeian inscription, No. 1782 of
the Corp. Inscr. Lat. Vol. Iv.: esse is understood, and the fol-
lowing accusatives are in apposition.

56. praeconem: v. 65 shows that he was not an official
herald, but an auctioneer: cp. A. P. 419: Cic. de Nat. Deor.
111. 34, 84 lzaec per praeconem vendidit. Mayor on Juv. V11. 6.

sine crimine. sor a preposition with its case serving as an
adjective cp. Ov. Am. 1. 3, ¹3 sme crzmz'ne mm cs, Trist. lv. 10,
