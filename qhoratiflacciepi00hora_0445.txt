NOTES. 409

Greek poetry which has moved the hearts of men, the last
Greek hexameters which retain the ancient cadence, the ma—
jestic melancholy flow’. Helle-nica p. 489.

404. vitae monstrata via est, by the gnomic poets,
Solon, Theognis, Phocylicles: Mahafsy Gr. Lz't. 1. 175, 187 sf.
Bergk Gr. Lil. 11. 0296, 332.

gratia regum; Pindar, Simonides and Bacchylides were
patronised by Hiero and Thero, anacreon by Polycrates of
Samos. ‘The rise and prevale-nce of tyrants in Greece, and
their desire of spieading r·culm1e about them, created a demand,
and a comfortable prospect sor prosessional court poctsst Ma-
haffyl. p. 206.

405-P1erfis· by the time of Horace this had become a
merely conventional literary epithet of the Muses. but its earlier
usage (Hesiod Op. 1 Μοῦσαι Πιερίηθεν, ἀοιδῇσι κλείουσαι, Sappho
frag. 4 βρόδων τῶν ἐκ Πιερίας) 1s of much importance as pointing
to an early school of Gr·eel poetry in that part of Thessaly
about Mt. Olympus. Cp. Geddes Homct r'zc Question pp. 25, 241.

ludus ‘festivals’z cp. Ep. 11. 1, 140 ff. Acron refers this
to the lyre, Orelli to the dramatic representations at the Dio-
nysia τὰ κατ’ ἀγρούς in December, which marked the close of
the year's toil: both unduly linxit the meaning. But Acron
is right in taking et...finis as a quasi-adjectival addition, ‘to
finish their long toils'.

406. ne...sit‚ not imperative, but final: ‘sthis I say) lest'
etc. So take Carm. 11. 4, 1 ne sit ansillae tila· amorpmlori...
prius...movit, and lv. 9, 1 ne forle credas etc. Cp. Ep. 1. 1, 13.

40⁷. sollers: so all good MSS. here, and usually: solers is
nowhere admissible. „s

408—418. Not only natural abz'lizjy, but also trained skill s
is neefftlfor success in poctry. Ἴ

408. natura.. ‚an arte: a theme often discnssed. Pindar
was perhaps the first to lay stress on the great importance of
φυὴ, as compared with μελέτη. cp. Olymp. 11. 86 (155) σοφὸς
ὁ πολλὰ εἰδὼς φυᾷ· μαθόντες δὲ λάβροι παγγλωσσίᾳ, κόρακες
ὥς, ἄκραντα γαρύετον Διὸς πρὸς ὀρνιχα θεῖον, xx here Dr Fennell
finds a reference to Simonides and Bacchylides: Prof. Jebb
doubts whether Simonides can be included (Jom nal of Hellenzc
studies, 111. p. 162). So Oly.mp lx 100 (152 ) τὸ δὲ φυᾷ
κράτιστον ἅπαν· πολλοὶ δὲ διδακταῖς ἀνθρώπων ἀρεταῖς κλέος ὥρου-
σαν ἄρεσθαι, ἄνευ δὲ θεοῦ σεσιγαμένον οὐ σκαιότερον χρημ’
ἕκαστον. But in Ol. XI. 20 he admits θήξαις δέ κε φύντ’ ἀρετᾷ.
Naturally Hor-'ace s solution of the question· -t-tha both natural

gifts and training are needed—is the one generally accepted:
cp Plat. Phaedr. 269 D εἰ μέν σοι ὑπάρχει φύσει ῥητορικῷ εἶναι,
