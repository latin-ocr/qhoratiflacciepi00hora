is the simplest. Mr Reid writes* ‘perhaps the line should be
explained by Prop. iv (v) 3, ‘z 1 dignior obliquo funem qui torqueat
Ocno, aeternusque tuam pascat, aselle, famem. Ocnus, eternally
twisting. the rope for the donkey to eat, was a favorite subject
with painters, and even a remote allusion to it would be easily
caught. In this case Horace has strongly personified pecuni,a
andb says in effect that it oftener represents the' imperious donkey,
which sw allows up the labours of Ocnus, than the patient Ocnus
who serves the donkey. This view is not free from objections,
but every other interpretation leaves torlum quite otiose ⁵.

Vacunae, the name of a Sabine goddess very variously
identified. Acron quotes Varro as identifying her with Victoria
et ca maxime lzi gaudent qui sapientia vincunt: but Corum. Cruq.
quotes the same passage from Varro as showing that she was
Minerva quod ea maxime lii gaudent, qui sapientiae vacant.
Others compared her with Bellona, Diana, Ceres or Venus, so
little did her attributes suit any goddess in particular. The fact
that Vespasian in restoring her temple dedicated it to Victoria
proves that this identification became the official one. But
doubtless Horace is here playing on an assumed connexion of
her name with vacare, as the patron goddess of holidays.
Preller (Rom. Myth. p. 360) believes that it is derived rather
from vacua, and that it refers to her patronage of the drainage so
necessary for the swampy land near Reate, where was her princi-
pal temple (cp. Ov. Fast. VI. 301, Merkel).

EPISTLE XI.

Nothing 1s known of the Bullatius to whom this Ep istle is
addressed. There' 1s no ieason to assume (with Ritter) that he
must have visited Asia' 111 the train of Augustus, when he made
his tour in the East in Β C. ’11- 19. Hence there is nothing
whatever to determine the date of the letter.
