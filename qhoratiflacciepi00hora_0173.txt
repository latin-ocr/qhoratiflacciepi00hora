because 1 was siek’‚ but ‘you are ready to give me, if Ι aui
sick’.

5. ficus prima: the fig ripens towards the end of August
and the beginning of September3 cp. Carm. 111. 23, S potul-'scm
grave tempus anno. There were also carly spring figs, formed
even before the leaves (cp. Plin. xv. 18, 71 sunt praeterea eaedem
serotinae et praecoces, biferae, αίῶιι ac nigra, cum messe vinde-
miaque maturescentes,- XVI. 26, ¹133 Meyer on Matth. xxi. 19,
Trench Miracles, p. 451), but these are of course not referred
to here.

6. dissignatorem: this form is the only one recognized
by good MSS. and by inscriptions. Cp. Ep. 1. 5, 16. The
dissignator was the man who marshalled the funeral procession,
not the dominus fitncris of Cic. de Leg. 11. 24, 61 dominusque
funeris utatur accenso alque lictoribus (as Macleane says), hut
one of his accensi (cp. Marquardt Privatalt. Ι. 357 note). Acron
says here designatores dicuntur qul acl locum [ἓ lucum] Libit?
in sunere praestanti conducuntur, ut dtsmzctz' cum honore :j
ftranlur. The name was also given to the officials who assigno-J.
places in the theatre: cp. Plaut. Poen. prol. 18...neu lic-lar
verbum aut virgae mutlicznl, neu dis-sagnator practer os obam-
bulet, neu sessum ducat, dum histrio in scaena siet, whence it
is clear that the lictor is here used generally for ‘ attendant ³,
with no reference to magistrates, as Ritter supposes: cp. Lip-
sius ad loc. “

ἅ. 7. pueris: cp. Mart. X. 62, 12 acslale pueri si valent, satis
escunt. ⁴

8. officiosa ‘in showing attentions': for officia in the sense of
the duties of civility due from clients and from citizens generally
see Mayor on Juv. 111. 126. The term would include the morn-
ing salutatio, the deductio z'n forum, visits to the sick, attendanee

at dwzddli'llzgs’ funerals, or when the toga virilis was assumed,
an t e 1 e.

opella ‘petty business': cp. Ep. 11. 2. 67. The word occurs
only here and in Lucr. 1. 1114.

9. testamenta resignat ‘unseals wills', i.e. causes deaths.
A will was usually written on tablets of wood or wax3 a senatus-
consultum (of the time of Nem, Suet. Ner. 17) enacted that they
were to be tied up with a triple thread, and then wax was to be
put over the thread and sealed by the testator, and also by wit-
nesseS. &Vhen sealed a will was deposited with some friend, or
in a temple, or with the Vestal virgins. After the testator’s
death as many of the witnesses as possible were collected, and
after they had acknowledged their seals, the thread was broken,
and the will read. Cp. Huschke Jurispr. Ante-Just. p. 558.
