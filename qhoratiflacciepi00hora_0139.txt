Bk. Ι. Ep. IL] NOTES. 103

if they neglect it in health, they will be forced to take to it as a
remedy: and in the same way, if men prefer indolent ease to
the study of philosophy, they will lose their rest from the <lis-
quieting pain caused by jealousy or love. Porphyrio rightly ex—
plains * si non propter philosophiam vigilaveris, propter invidiam
et amorem dormire non poteris-² cures, though defended by
Bentley.. has no good MS. authority, and is quite needless.
hydropicuS, cp. Celsus 111. 21 hydropicus multum ambulandum,
currendum aliquando est.

35. posces librum, as Horace himself may have done, for in
Sat. 1. 6. 122 ad quartam iaceo refers only to his reclining on his

lectus luczcbratorius, his ‘ easy chair in his study' as we should say, ,

as we see from the following words lecto aut scripto quod me taci-
tum iuvet.

36. studiis et rebus honest-is, probably not a hendiadys:
but studz'is=‘ studies⁷ as in Ep. 11. 2. 82, Sat. 1. ιο. 21. The
case is dative, not ablative.

37. Nam ‘whyl ' a particle expressing surprise or indignation.
Cp. Plaut. Aul. 42 nam cur me verberas. Ter. Andr. 612 nam
quid dicam patri? So in Greek τί γὰρ κακὸν ἐποιὴσεν; (Luke xxiii.
22). In such cases the force is the same as that of the interroga-
tive with nam suffixed, and some MSS. here have curnam.

38. oculum, not, as Bentley supposed, supported by the best
MSS. but still to be preferred to oculos as the neater expression.

festinaS...diffe1-s, the omission of the copula is usual in the
ease of two contrasted questions.

39. est animum: cp. Hom. Il. vx. 201 Βελλεροφόντης...
ἀλᾶτο ὃν θυμὸν κατέδων, translated by Cic. Tusc. 111. 26, 63
ipse suum cor edens: Aesch. Ag. 103 τήν θυμοβόρσν φρένα λύπην.

40. dimidium...habet. There is a Greek proverb, of un-
certain origin ἁρχὴ δέ τοι ἥμισυ παντόςε cp. Soph. Frag. 715 ἔργον
δὲ παντὸς ἦν τις ἄρχηται καλῶς, καὶ τοὶς τελευτὰς εἰκὸς ἔσθ’ οὕτως
ἔχειν, our own ‘well begun is half done’.

aude ‘have courage': Verg. Aen. VIII. 364 Ande, hospes,
contemnere opes. Ep. 11. 2. 148.

42. rusticus exspectat ‘is like the clown waiting' ε defluat
Roby §e 1664, S. G. ξ 692. [defluit preferred by Hand, Turs.
11. ⁸341 is found in none of Keller’s MSS. and could hardly stand]
Th1s seems to be a reference to a fable of a rustic waiting by the
banks of a river until all the water had run by: but as no trace
of such a sable has been discovered elsewhere, it may be only in—
vented by Horace for this passage. Whether Juvenal’s rusticus
