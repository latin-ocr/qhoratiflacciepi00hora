256 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

appeared to Aeneas (p. 109). The line memini me fieri pavum
(Ann. v. 15 Vahl.) refers apparently only to Ennius himself.
Tertullian gives the order as Euphorbus, Pythagoras, Homer, a
peacock by a bold anachronism. Mommsen’s words ‘The re-
markable vision, with which the poem (of the Annals) opens, tells
in good Pythagoream style how the soul now inhabiting Quintus
Ennius had previously been domiciled in Homer and still earlier
in a peacock ⁷, seem based on the language of Persius, which

may only be a distorted expression of the satirist; cp. Conington⁷s
note. Conington here render-s

‘nor cares how he redeems
the gorgeous promise of his peacock dreams’.

53. nonznomze, as in Carm. ΙΙΙ. 20, 1 non vides, and osten
elsewhere. Bentley first gave the true meaning to this passage, by
making it interrogative, ‘Did Ι say that Ennius is now sure ot
his place? Why even Naevius, so -much more archaic a writer, is
still always in our hands, and familiar to us, as if he were almost
one of our own time'. Naevius served in the First Punic War,
and therefore could not have been born later than about B.C. 260:
he died about B.C. 200. (Cicero Brut. 15, 60 says in B.C. ¹204,
but there is reason to believe that he lived at least three or four
years longer: cp. Mommsen Hz'st. ΙΙ. 437 note.) Ennius was
born B.C. 239, and died B.C. 169, so that Cic. Tusc. Ι. 1, gmakes
a slip in speaking of him as older than Naevius, unless, as is pro-
bable‚ the words there used are due to an inaccurate marginal

gloss. In any case the poetry of Naevius was decidedly more
archaic than that of Ennius.

The extant fragments of his tragedies (about 400 lines), admirably
discussed by Prof. Sellar‚ and more in detail by Ribbeck (Riimz'sclze
Daga'die, pp. 216-339) do not enable us to determine precisely
why the epithet of doctus is given to him, though they ‘bear evi-
dence to his moral strength and worth, and to the manly fervour,
as well as the gentle humanity of his temperament ⁷. It is pron
bably because of his wide acquaintance with Greek literature:

blut we need not be concerned to maintain the justice of the epi-

Accius (Bc. 170—about B.c. 90l: oratorical fervour and pas-
sionate energy are conspicuous in his fragments (cp. Sellar, pp.
146-7). Quintilian says (Χ. 1, 97) virium Attio plus tribuitur,
