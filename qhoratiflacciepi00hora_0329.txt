Bk. 11. Ep. IL] NOTES. 293

exemta venui proponuntur ’, an interpretation which is as faulty
as the language in which it is suggested. Keller quotes Ter.
Hec. 173, Plaut. Mil. 977 (but see Tyrrell's note), Asin. 586, as
instances in which excludo appears as a salse reading ior ex-
trudo.

12. meo in aere, so Cic. in Verr. 1v. 6, 11 has hominem
video non modo in aere alieno nullo, scd in suis nummis mullis
esse ac semper fnisse. pauper often denotes ‘not poverty but
means sleuder yet sufficient, as coutrastcd with infigas or egens.

Cp. Ep. 1. ιο, 32.

13. mangonum, ‘the slave-dealem& The derivation of the
word mango (which the dictionaries based on Freund by an over-
sight say is post-Augustam), from μάγγανον ⁴ a charin or philtre',
commonly given is incorrect. The words may be ultimately
akin3 but the meanings diver-ge too widely to admit of direct
derivation. It can hardly be doubted that mango is identical
with our —monger (A.-S. mangere ‘a dealer’)‚ Germ. -mengm3
from mangian ‘to traffic', and ultimately from mang ‘a mixture‘.
The use of mangania), etc. with the notiori of ‘to decl< out, set
off’ is later, and seems to be derived from the practice of the
mangones, and not vice versa.

b dnon. temere ε Ep. 11. 1, 120. I would not do this for every-
ο y.

14. cessavit, ‘shirked his work’: cp. cessator Sat..11. 7,
100.

ut fit ‘as usual’, as boys will do: cp. Cic. Verr. Act. 11. ii.
23, 56 queri, utfil, incipiunt.

15. in scalis latuit: the wooden staircase in the corner os
the house (so always at Pompeii) furnished the most natural tem-
porary hiding- place: cp. Cic. pro Mil. 15, 40 cum se zlle [Clodius]
Jugz'ens in scalmum lat bras abdzszsset Ι) hil. 11. 9, 2 1 nisi se i‘lte
z'n scalas tab 7nae libmazae comec· sset: Cic. pro Cor.n siag. 50
comepsz't 7’77 scalas (quoted by Schol. vet. on Juven VII-118).

pendentis not to be connected with 7“77 scalis, as is done by
Acron, though he inconsistently adds (in Hauthal's text) et in
media domo ad timorem incutiendum lzahvza pendebat, which is
doubtless correct. The whip (halamaz lorum, as in Vei-,g Aen.
V11. 380 of the whip used by a boy to lash his top) was hung up
in some conspicuous part of the house.

16. des nummos, there are three possible ways of taking
this phrase: (1) as a hypothetical subjunctive in apodosis to si
velit, (2) as a conditional subjunctive without si expressed (Roby
ἓ 1552. S. G. ἑός-,0, 1. (a): cp. Sat. 11. 3, 57): (3) as ajussive
subjunctive. In the first two cases the speech of the vendor ends
