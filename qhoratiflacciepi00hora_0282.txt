246 ΗΘΚΛ Τ] EPISTULAE.

decree was not carried into effect in consequence of an inroad of
the Dacians and a rising of the Dalmatians, followed by a
campaign under Drusus in Germany. Ritter argues from this
that the Epistle must have been finished before the news of
these fresh wars had reached Rome, when it was still expected
that the temple of Janus would be closed. But the temple of
Janus was closed three times during the reign of Augustus
(Suet. Aug. XXII„ Mon. Ancyr. ΙΙ. 45). The first time was in
B.C. 29, after his return from Egypt; the second in B.C. 25, at
the close of the first Cantabrian war. The date of the third
closing cannot be determined. Orosius (vi. 22) assigns it to
the year of Christ’s birth, a tradition apparently accepted by
Milton (flymn on tlte Nativity, stanza iv.): this rests on very
slight authority, but Mommsen (on Mon. Ancyr. p. 32) is not
‹lisinclined to accept it as approximately true. In any case the
reference in v. 255 is too general to admit of being pressed.

More valid arguments have been adduced by Vahlen (Manass-
bericlzte der Bcrlz'ner Akadmzie 1878, pp. 688 ff). In v. 111
Horace refers to his resumption of a form of poetical com—
position which he had formally renounced. This can only mean
lyric poetry. Now the Carmen Saeculare was written in B.C.
17, and most if not all of the Odes in the Fourth Book between
B.C. 17 and B.C. 13. There appear to be references to some of
these in vv. 252 ff. (erg. to V. 25 ff„ XIV. 11, 29, 33, XV. 6, 9),
or at least to the themes of which they treat. Hence the Epistle
can hardly have been written before B.C. 13. In this year
Augustus returned to Rome after an absence of three years in
Gaul, and remained in Rome until B.C. 10.

Suetonius (vit. Horat.) tells us that Augustus post sermones
quosdam lectos complained that there was no mention made of
himself, and said to the poet irasci me tibi scito, quod non z'n
plerisque eiusmodi scrzptis meeum potissimum loquaris, An
vereris, ne apud posteros infame tibi sit, quod videaris familiaris
nobis esse? In this way expressit eclogam acl se cuius initium
est: Cum tot sustineas, etc. Ritter thinks that Suetonius was
mistaken in supposing that this Epistle was the one written by
Horace in answer to the remonstrances of Augustus3 and argues
that it must have been Ep. Ι. 13. His reasons for this view are
(1) that this was written too long after the publication of the
Satires, and (2) that Aug-ustus in acknowledging the receipt of
Horace's libellus complains of it as being as short as the poet
was himself: pertulit ad me Dionysius libellum tuum, quem
ego, ut excusantem, quantuluscunque est, boni consulo. Vereri
autem milzz' videris, ne maiores libelli tui sint, quam z'pse' es. Sed
sz' tibi statura dest, corpusculum non dest. ltaque licebit in sex-
{ariolo scribas: quo circuitus voluminis tui sit ὀὙκωδέστατος,
sicul est ventriculi tui. It may be replied to the first of these
objections that Sermones is by no means necessarily limited to
