350 ARS POETICA.

75. impariter, one of Horace's ἅπαξ λεγόμενα. queri-
monia, i.e. elegy. Horace seems to allude to the traditional
derivation of ἔλεγος from ἔ ἔ λέγειν ‘to say ah me’, a derivation
quite impossible for scientific etymology. As the word denoted
primarily a plaintive tune played on the. Phrygian pipe, it is
probably of Phrygian origin (Mahaffy, 1. p. 157). ’1110 Phry-
gian αὔλησις became widely familiai in Greece in connexion
with the worship of Dionysus and the Phrygian Mother of the
Gods, est ecially through the compositions of Olympus: and
there is reason to believe that it was especially used in laments
over the dead ε cp. Plutarch, de εἶ c. XXI. ὁ αὐλὸς ὀψὲ καὶ πρώην
ἐτόλμησε φωνὴν ἐφ’ ἱμερτοῖσιν ἀφεῖναι, τὸν δὲ πρῶτον χρόνον
εἵλκετο πρὸς τὰ πένθη, καὶ τὴν περὶ ταῦτα λειτουργίαν ού μάλα
ἔντιμον οὐδὲ φαιδρὰν εἶχεν, εἶτ’ ἐμίχθη παντάπασιν. But it was
Callinus of Ephesus (circ. B.C. 665) who first wrote verses in
elegiae metre, to be sung to the accompaniment of the pipe.
(Bergk, Gr. Litteralnrgesclz. ΙΙ. 12 5 ff.) His poems were not of
a religious character, but adapted for ordinary social intercourse.
The only important fragment which we possess (some twenty
lines) was intended to stir up his countrymen to greater energy
in their struggle with the Magnetes (Bergk, ib. pp. 178—180).
Archilochus somewhat later used the same mette as a vehicle
sor the expression of the most varied emotions, introducing
many references to his personal history. Tyrtaeus (circ. B.c.
600—580) followed more closely in the steps of Callinus, dealing
in his Εὐνομία with the interna] disorders and external dangers
os Lacedaemon. Mimnermus of Colophon (cire. B.C. 575) wrote
mainly, butnot exclusively, love-poenis, and henceis often regarded
as the inventor of the erotic elegy (cp. Ep. 11. 2, 100), here denoted
by voti sententia compos ‘the feelings of one who has gained
his prayer’, i.e. of a successful lover. The ‘sweet and tender'
character traditionally ascribed to the poetry of Mimnermus is
not, in the opinion of Bergk (ib. 11. 262), justified by ‘the vigor-
ous and manly tone' in which he expresses even sorrowful emo-
tions: but a large proportion of the extant fragments consist of
querimoniae over the approach of old age. His love for the
flute-girl Nanno, who rejected him, was not voti compos. In-
deed successful love is rarely a theme for elegiae verse: hence
Michaelis prefers to understand the words here of the epigram.

77. exiguos refers mainly to the slighter and less dignified
character of elegiacs as compared with hexameters, as Ovid
(Am. 11. 1, 21) calls them leves: but it may allude also to the
more confined metrical structure. Cp. Tennyson's ‘tiny poem’.

78. grammatici ‘our teachers'‚ i. e. professors of litera-
ture, as in Ep. Ι. 19, 40. The origin of the doubt may have
arisen from the fact that there was nothing plaintive or mournsul
in the stirring ‘elegies' of Callinus.
