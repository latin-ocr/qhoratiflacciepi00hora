1 1) to C. Marius is the equivalent of incultis moribus in Sall. Jug.
85, 39: hence as Bentley saw, et, not nec, is the right reading.
It has also far better authority. In good prose an adverb of
quality, as distinguished from one of degree, is not used with an
adjective, as here, and in A. P. 3 turpz'leratrum, Carm. 111. 11, 35
splendide mendax. Cp. Kiihner 11. p. 597. Nagelsbach Stil.
p. 239. ·

23. acuis, a metaphor derived from sharpeningaa weapon,
Cic. Brut. 97, 331 tu illuc (in forum) veneras unus, qui non
linguam modo acuisses exercitatione dicendi &c.; de Orat. 111. 3ο,
121 non enim solum acuenda nobis neque procudenda lingua est.

31⁰ θτΙζγειν γλῶσσαν. The reference is to the practice of declama-
tion p. 1. 2, 2.

civica iura. respondere : the phrase in prose is ius civile re·
spondere (Plin. Ep. Vl. 15), cp. de Orat. 1. 45, 198. For
respondere with an acc. ‘to put sorward in a reply‚’ disputare ‘to
put forward in discussi0n‚' cp. Reid on Cic. Acad. 11. 29, 93.
civicus is a poetical sorm sor civilis (cp. Carm. 11. 1, 1, 111. 24, 26),
like hosticus (Carm. 111. 2, 6) sor hostilis ,· it is not used by Cicero,

excgpt in {ge technical phrase civica corona (pro Plane. 3ο, 72:

24. amabile ‘charming‘‚ with no direct reference to amatory
poetry‚ though doubtless including this.

25. hederae, the victor’s wreath is made of ivy, because that
plant is sacred to Bacchus, by whom poets are inspired. Cp.
Carm. 1. 1, ‘²9 doctarum hederae praemia frontium. Verg. Ecl.
vu. 2 5. Prop. V. ι, 61 Ennius hirsuta cingat sua dicta corona:
mi folia ex lzedera porrige, Bacche, tua. Pindar calls Bacchus
κισσοδέταν θεόν (F rag. 45, 9), and κισσοφόρον Ol. 11. 50.

26. frigida curarum fomenta. There are two chief diffi-
culties here, the force of fi7gida, and the case of curarum.
fibmenta being medical applications, are they intended to relieve
the curae, or do they consist in the curae? Is the genitive one
of the object (Roby ἓ 1312, S. G. ἓ 525), or of material (Roby
ἓ 1304, S. G. ἓ 523)Ρ It seems to me that the curae, the pur-
suit of petty ambition and the love of money, are what Horace
wishes Celsus to abandon, as hindering him in attaining the
blessings which philosophy (sapientia) alone can give. In that
case, the fomenta must consist in the curae. Frigida will then
have its full natural meaning as ‘ chilling '‚ the cares are repre-
sented as chilling appliances which kill all generous warmth of
spirit. No difficulty arises from the fact that fomenta primarily
meant warm applications‚ for the word had acquired a more
general meaning, so that the medical writer Cornelius Celsus
can speak of both warm and cold, both dry and wetsomenta.
