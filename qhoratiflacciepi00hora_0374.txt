3 38 ΑΕΒ POETJCA.

21. coepit institui: epm-Ep 11.1‚ 149 (note). The urceus
or ‘pitcher’ , though not necessarily smaller than the amphora,
was so as a rule. and the sentence gains in point if we suppose
that to a vessel of the size osan ampliora, the shape of an urceus
was given, at any rate, it was something very different. rota,
of course the potter' s wheel· . cp. Senec. Ep. XC. 31 Anacharsis
inquit, invenit rotam figuli, cuius circuitu vasa formantur. But
itis mentioned by Homer Il. XV111. 600. exit: cp. Pers. 1. 45

non eov, cum scrzbo, sifhr te quid aptius exit, quando llaec rat ¹a avis
est, sz quid tamen aptzus exit, landari metuam.

23. quidvis, a reading restored by Bentley sor the vulgate
quod vis: the latter has the support of almost all MSS„ and
would mean quod instituis: but this is very frigid, and Ritter is
the only recent editor who defends it.

dumtaxat ‘provided only it be'. Cp. Reid on Cic. Lael.
ἓ 53. simplex, i.e. constituting a single and uniform whole.

24—31. Prof. Nettleship takes these lines to be again apara-
phrase of the Greek original, with Horace’s comment in vv.

32—37. lee desire to avoid α fault must be directed by know-
ledge, or tlze opposite fault z's incurred.

25. specie recti ‘ by our idea of what is right’: species is not
here in a bad sense, a mere phantom: cp. Quint. VIII. 3, 56
κακόζηλον vocatur quicquid est ultra virtutem, quoties ingenium
iudicio caret ct specie boni fallitur: omnium in eloquentia vitiorum

pessimum. The word is often used in Cicero with the meaning
of ‘ general notion ³: ἰδέα.

26. levia. ‘smoothness ’, τὴν λειότητα of the rhetoricians, to
which vigour and energy (δεινότης) was in danger of being sacri-
ficed. Bentley preferred lenia, which has very slight authority:
the passage from Cic. Brut. 48, 177 sunt cius aliquot orationes ex
quibus...lenitas eius sine nervis conspici potest, adduced in support
of this reading, tells really rather against it. We do not want
quite a repetition of the same idea, but a slight variation, as in
brevis, )( obscurus. A man who aims at an excellence is in
danger of falling into a fault, closely connected with it: but
lenia would denote not an excellence, but a fault. Keller points
out that as the archetype was undoubtedly written in capita1s‚
the difference between the two words is not so slight as it is in
MSS. written in small letters.

nervi: cp. Cic. Brut. 31, 121 qzczs Aristotrle nervosior?
Quint. VHL proem. 18 resistam iis, qui omissa rerum, qui nervi
sunt in causis, diligentia quodam inani circa voces studio senescunt.
ln good Latin nervus, like νεΐρον, always denotes sinews or
tendons (literal or metaphorical): cp. Celsus vm. 1 nervi quos
