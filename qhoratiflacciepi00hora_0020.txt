Of the individual epistles, Ep. i. 13 Was evidently
contemporaneous with the publication of Odes i.—iii.
Of the others all those whose date can be assigned
with any certainty, appear to belong to B.c. 20. But
it is probable that Horace was engaged with this style
of composition more or less at various times during
the five years Rc. 24—20‚ that is to say from the
fortieth to the forty-fifth year of his age.

The conclusions to which we are thus brought are
practically the same as those maintained by Franke,
and supported by the weighty approval of Lachmann.
Bentley in his preface assigned a slightly later date,
and needlessly limited the time of composition to two
years (Bc 20—19); Ritter holding that Odes i—iii.
were published in B.C. 19 is compelled to postpone
the publication of the first Book of the Epistles to
ac. 18.

The time of the publication of the Second Book
'and of the Ars poetica is open to more doubt.
But the dates of composition, which' on the whole
seem most probable, are for Ep. ii. 1 about 13.C. 13,
for Ep. ii. 2 about 13.C. 19, and for the Ars Poetica,
B.C. 20 or 19. The reasons which lead us to these
conclusions will be found in the Introductions to
the several Epistles. If they are sound, Book ΙΙ.

was published in 13.c. 13, and the Ars may have
been issued earlier and separately.

The view, which till recently has been the most
generally accepted, assigns Ep. ii. 1, ,τι to a period
