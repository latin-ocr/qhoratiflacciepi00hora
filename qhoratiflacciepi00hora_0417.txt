NOTES. 381

Aristolle’s Rhetoric p. 282 (note) writes ικύριον (ὄνομα) is the
“proper ” word by which any object is (lesignated‚ and [which is]
commonly employed to denote it. It is therefore opposed to all
the other kinds of words: to all figurative, foreign, archaic, or
in any way “uncomm0n” words-...any words which strike us as
strange or unusual‘. Cicero de Orat. 111. 37, 149 contrasts
propria verba with metaphorical (qm ze l1¹anss'·1¹tmlm·) and newly
introduced or coined (quae m: amns afuimus ipsz) expressions.
Cp. Orator 24, 80, Quint. vlit. 3, 24 (p1¹0p1¹za,stt·la, translata)
Arist. Rhet.111. 2, 2.

nomina.. &verba ὀνόματα...ῥήματα,“ nounsand verbs' covered
with Plato the whole of language (cp. Cratyl. 431 Β λόγοι ’γάρ
που, ὠς ἐγῷμαι, ἡ τούτων [ῥημάτων καὶ ὀνομάτων] ξύνθεσίς ἐστιν;
cp. 425 A): and though Aristotle added the σύνδεσμος and the
Stoics completed the ‘parts of speech ’‚ the names of the two
chief classes were osten used in the same wide sense, as here.
Cp. Sat. 1. 3, 103 donec verba quibus voces sensusque notarent,
nominaque invenere. But cp. Palmer there.

235. satyrorum scriptor, i.e. if I were to write satyric
dramas: the Greek critics denote these sometimes by the word
σάτυροιε eg. Demetr. de Eloc. 169 (Rhet. Gr. lx. 76 XValz)
οὐδὲ ’γὰρ ἐπινοήσειεν ἄν τις τραγῳδιοιν παίζουσαν, ἐπεὶ σάτυρον
’γράψει ἀντὶ τραγῳδίας. Horace means to say that he would not
confine himself strictly to the plainest language‚ and avoid so
completely the elevated tone of tragedy as to reduce his semi-
divine characters to the level of slaves in comedy.

236. differre with dat. as in Sat. 1. 4, 48 nisi quodpcde c'erta
{zfflrt sermoni, sermo merus: cp. v. 1523 Ep. 11. τι, 193> : colori
p. 1. 17, 23.

237. Davus, a common slave’s name, said to be from Δίῐος, a
Dacian, the older name of this tribe having been Δᾶοι, according
to Strabo vu. 304. The name occurs in the Andria of Terence;
—Forcellini and the dictionaries based on Freund say also in
Plautus, but this is an error: no character in Plautus bears the
narne3 it occurs only in Amphitr. 361 as ajest. Cp. Sat. Ι. 10,
40, and ΙΙ. 5, 91 where the name is typical⁷ as here, and 11. 7, ς’.
where it is ascribed to a slave belonging to Horace.

et audax: a striking instance of the value of the vel. Bland.
and the oldest Berne MS. when in agreement. These (and
the Munich MS. C, which comes from the same source as the
Berne MS.) alone have et: all other MSS. have the evidently
erroneous an.

238. Pythias, not the ancilla in the Eunuchus of Terence,
but according to Acron a girl in a comedy of Lucilius, who
cheated her master out of a taient. As Lucilius is not known
