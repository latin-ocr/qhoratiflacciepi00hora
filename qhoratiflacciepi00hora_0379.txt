iunctura cannot refer, as some have supposed, either to com-
position, or to nietaphor.

49. indiciis: σημείοις. ‘ Indicia verba appellavit: philo-
sophi enim dicunt indicandarnm rerum causa inventas esse voces.'
Porph. Perhaps this use of indicium is intended as a case of
callida iunctm a.

abdita. rerum ‘new conceptions’, not previously brought to
view. The great majority of MSS. read mrum et, which was
omitted (silently) by Bentley, and which almost all editors recog-
nize as indesensible. There is a similar erroneous addition in
Ep. 11. 1, 73.

50. cinctutis: qm’ cinctu znduebantur. The cmctus was a
broad waistband‚ or loin- eloth, w orn by the old Romans instead
of the tunzca under the toga, and by the younger men in their
exercises in the Campus, whence it was also called campestre.
The younger Cato wore it in accordance with the ancient practice
(Ascon. p. 30, 9 Or. Cato praetor iudicium, quia aestate agebatur,
sine tunica exercuit, campestri sub laga cim-tus), and Porph. here
says: omnes enim Cethegi 111111111 morem setvaverunt Romae...
nunquam enim tunica usi sunt : ideo cz'nctutas eos dixit quoniam
cinctus est genus tunicae infra pectus aptatae. As the arms and
breast were lest bare Lucan 11. 543 speaks of exsertique manus
vesana Cetlzegz' ; and Sil. Ital. VIlI. 587 has ipse umero exsertus
gentili more parentum difficili gaudebat equo. This must be dis-
tinguished from the cinctus Gabinus, which was the old way of
wearing the toga in time of war. Cp. Marquarffl, leiim. Prz'vatczlt.
11. 159, 167. Several figures wearing the cinctus are represented
in Daremberg and Saglio's Dictionnaire des A ntiquitair, p. 1173.

51. continget ‘you will be allowed’: not very commonly
used so without the dative expressed, as in Ep. 1. 17, 36,
11. 2. 41.

pudenter=cum pudore, i. e. ‘with moderation’.

52. fictaque: Bentley wished to change this into fizctaq: (e,
because offinffere' ln v. 50, but the repetition is pleasing rather
than otherwise. The phrase fmue 110111111 zerbum is good
enough in itself: cp. Cic. Orat. 61, 211 x« 1th Sandys' note. “

habebunt· fidem ‘will find acceptance’ or ‘creditss The
limitation is at first sight by no means clear. Why should
newly-coined words find favour only if they come falling like
