’ 10. inflecti ε the table in a Roman dining-room had couches

on three sides of it : the imus lectus was the couch on the lest-hand
osone standing on the fourth side, and looking towards the table.
This coueh was generally assigned to the scurrae, if there were
any in the party: in Sat. 11. 8 it is occupied by the host with a
scurra on either hand. The daia-or, while flouting at others
would be servile towards the patron: Porphyrion takes it as
‘eorum derisor qui in imo lecto accumbunt'‚ a man who jeers at
she huinbler guests: but this is not likely'to be right. Nor is
Schiitz right in taking imi lecti as an attribute to aller. It is
perhaps not necessary with Kr'tiger to suppose ut omitted, as in
Ep. 1. 2, 42; 6, 63: the first man is not compared to but is a
deaeisor, whose place is on the lowest couch.

12. teuit: i. e. he calls attention to words that drop from
his patron's lips, and might otherwise pass unnoticed. Cp. A.P.

368.

14. reddere: cp. Cic. de Nat. Deor. Ι. 26, 72 ista a vobis
quasi dictala redduntur.- Ep. 1. 1, 55. The dative magistro
seems to depend upon reddere, not on dictata.

partis secundas: in the mimes the reile of the actor who
played the second part seems to have been to follow the lead of
the chief actor, and to imitate him in word and gesture, with
perhaps something of caricature. Suetonius (Calig. LVII.) tells
a curious story: cum in Laureolo mimo [Mayor on Juv. VIII. 187]
in quo actor proripiens se ruina sanguinem vomit, plures secun-
darum certatim experimentum artis darent, cruore scaena abnn-
davit.

⁹ 15. rixatur. The difficulty of this passage seems to me to
have been exaggerated by many commentators, who propose all
kinds of emendations. Keller e. g. takes objection to the asyn-
deton between rixatur and propugnat, to the obscure construction
of nugis between ‚propugnat and armatus, to the late Latinity
of the construction of propagrnare with the dative, and to the
meaning ‘furious’ which he thinks must be attached to armatus.
None of these seem to me serious difficulties. Asyndeton is by
no means unexampled in Horace ; nugis is clearly connected by
,the context with propugnat ; the construction of propugnat with
the dative is perfectly natural, even if it does not actually occur
in any good writer ; and armatas here has its usual sense. The
rendering ‘takes up arms and fights in defence of trifles’ is quite
legitimate and appropriate. Muretus removed the asyndeton by
reading rz‘xator (accepted by Keller and KrUger), but this is not
found before Quintilian (xi. Ι. 29). The vet. Bland has rixatus,
sor which, as Bentley also pointed out, rixans would certainly
have been required. Bentley’s own correction, to read caprina
et is ,clumsy. Ribbeck ingeniously but needlessly reads animatus
