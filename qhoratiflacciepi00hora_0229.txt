Macleane) is hardly justified in saying that the valley of Licenza

12. fone, identified by the scholiasts with the sons Bandu-
siae of Carni. 111. 13, 1 : but it is not even certain that the latter
was not in Apulia. The name of this spring must have been
the same as that of the stream, i.e. Digentia (Ep. 1. 18, ¹04)-

dassre idoneus, a Greek construction: cp. Ep. 1. 2, 27 (note).

13. Erigidlor: Ep. 1. 3, 3 (note). ambiat “flows winding
through’, not ‘flows around'. We should say rather ‘so that
Hebrus is not cooler or clearer in its winding course through

Thrace ’.

14. capiti...a1vo: Ep. Ι. 15, 8 (note).

utilis, utilis: the repetition is not out of keeping with the

negligent style of a familiar letter, and is supported by a great
preponderance of authority. Either from a deliberate correction

or from the loss of one of the words (actually occurring in one
Ms.), some MSS. read aptus et utilis.

15. dulces ‘dear to me’. amoenae ‘charmingin themselves'‚
objectively. Bentley read ct (iam sz' aredis), ‘and, if you believe
it, now that you have heard my account’, and several good
editors have followed him. But there is sufficient distinction
between dulces and amoenae in meaning, to bear the weight of the
etiam ‘and even'. Mr Reid thinks all attempts to explain -si
credis unsatisfactory, and suggests that Horace may have written
the very common si quaeris: cp. Lucil. 1006 (Lachm.) sermone
bono, et, sz‘ quaeri', libenter. This does not touch the difficulty
as to the force of amoenae.

16. tibi, ethic dative, showing that the health of Horace
was a matter of interest to Quinctius. Septembribus horis: cp.
Ep. 1. 7, 5ff., Sat. 11. 6, 19.
