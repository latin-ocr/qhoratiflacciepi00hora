NOTES 371

os Plautus and Terence into five acts is due only to the gram-
marians, and is osten very unskilsully made (cp. Lorenz Einlci-
tung zur Alostellamh, p. 17); perhaps it is due only to this dic-
tum in Horace. The modern division into acts dates from the
edition ofJ. Β. Ρίι15, Milan, 1500 ff. (Qleuffel lx’.0m th. §86).
But Donatus pules ἵεν. Ad lplz. says haec ctiam ut celera hui-us
cemodi poemata qumque actus habeat neccsse est chous diffusos a
Graeczs paens, qnos etsi nttnmdz causa iam immutatos ςριῑίαίσνεε
minime distinguunt Latini comz'ci...tamen a doctis veteribus dis-
creti atque disiuncti sunt. Still there were no doubt pauses in
the action of most, if not of all plays; and these were filled up
by the music of the flute-player. Cp. Plaut. Pseud. 574 R. (at
the end of Act Ι.) Tibicen vos inlcrca hic delectaverit. So pro-
bably at the end ofActs I. III.and IV. osthe Mostellaria the stage
was left empty, but not at the end of Act II.—-Cicero evidently
knew only the division into three acts: cp. ad Quint. fr. Ι. 1, 16,
46 illud te ad extremum el oro ct hortor, ul tanquam poetae boni
et actores industrii solent, sic tu in extrema parte et conclusione
muneris ac negotii tui dilzgrentz'ssz'mus sis, ut laic terlz'us annus
imperii tui tanquam tertius actus petfictt'ssimus ct ornatissimus
fuisse videntur. In de Sen. 19, 70 modo in quoczmquefm’m't actu
probetur he seems to use aelus loosely for ⁴ scene'. —The justice
of the rule has been often, and not without reason disputed: and
some os the greatest modern playw rights, especially among the
Freneh, prefer the division into three acts.

190. spectata has certainly less authority than spectanda
(especially as the old Berne MS. has exspectanda), but it seems
to be required by the sense. In Sat. Ι. 10, 39 where putanda
is certainly right, many MSS. have spectata, but here the con-
verse confusion seems to have taken place. There 1s a tautology
111 ‘to be brought forward once more to be seen’, which there 15
not in ‘aster it has once been seen, to be brough‘· out again'.
[Why not take 7ep0nz' as ‘to be laid aside’ ? spectanda u 1ll then
come in; ita reponi ut spectanda sit: i. e. the play may still hope
for some more performances. J. s. R. ]

191. nec deus intersit, cx maclam as the proverbial ex-
pression has it. According to Pollux 1V.128 ὴ μηχανή θεοὺς
δείκνυσι καὶ ἥρως τοὺς ἐν ἀέρι.. ,καὶ κεῖται κατὰ, τήν ἀριστερὰν πάρο-
δον, ὑπὲρ τὴν σκηνὴν τὸ ύψος. Plat. Cratyl. p. 425 D says ὥσπερ
οἱ τραγῳδοποιοί, ἐπειδάν τι ἀπορῶσιν, ἐπι ταῖς μηχανὰς καταφεύ-
’γουσι θεοὺς αἴροντες, and similarly Cic. de Nat. D. Ι. 20, 53 ut
lragzcz‘ poetae, cum explzcme argumenti erzlum non pote'slzs, con-
fugitis-ad deum. Aristotle (Ρο61. Χν. 11) says φανερὸν ὅτι καὶ
τὰς λύσεις τῶν μυθων ἐξ αὐτου δεῖ τοῦ μύθου συμβαίνειν, καὶ μὴ
ὥσπερ ἐν τῇ Μηδείᾳ ἀπὸ μηχανῆς. But no dczly appears in the
