412 ARS POETICA.

sels-denial for their public appearances, but nowadays men are
satisfied with saying that they would account it a disgrace not to
be able to write poetry, even though they have never studied the
art'. Ritter, Schiitz, Keller, Kriiger, Dillenbiirger and others
retain nunc, the Scholiasts knew no other reading, and Conington
evidently adopts it for his translation. If any correction were
needed, Ι should prefer Jeep’s lzzcic to Bentley's nec.

41⁷. occupet extremum scabies ‘deuce take the hind-
most’: according to Porphyrion ‘hoc ex lusu puerorum sustulit,
qui ludentes solent dicere: quisquis ad me novissimus venerit,
habeat scabiem’. L. Miiller has rearranged the line, so as to
make a trochaic tetrameter catalectic, like that quoted in Ep. 1.
1, 593 lza'heat scabiem quisquis ad me ve‘nerit novlssimus. Acron
describes the game somewhat differently.

418. sane, not ‘modestly' (more sani hominis), nor yet ‘cer-

tfalinly' (zutique Or.)‚ but ‘altogether⁷, like sane sapis often in
autus.

419—452. leejudffizent offlatterers must not be accepted, but
a rz'clz poet can hardly tell {rue friends from fizlse ones. Quinti-
lius was an honest critic ; and α good man will never conceal lzz's
friend 's errors from him.

420. ad. lucrum ‘to make their profit out of him'. A crier
endeavours to attract purchasers by promising thern good bar-
gains, a rich man, who writes verse, attracts an audience of
flatterers by the hope that they will gain something. Hence
v. 421 is not superfluous, as Schiitz thinks, but necessary to the
meaning. It is repeated from Sat. 1. 2, 13 in a different con-
nexion, just as Ep. Ι. 1, 56 is repeated from Sat. 1. 6, 74, and
Sat. 1. 4, 92 from Sat. Ι. 2, 27, though the last instance is not
quite parallel. The satirists are full of instances in which a
dinner was the reward for listening to the host‘s poetry: e. g.
Mart. ΙΙΙ. Ι llaec tibi, non alia, est ad cenam causa vocandi, versi-
culos recites ut, Ligurine, ταας,- etc..· cp. 11. 27, 111. 45, VII. 42,
lx. 14.

422. si vero est: vero does not here introduce a climax, as
Schiitz thinks, but is simply adversative: a rich poet can get
plenty of admirers‚ but I shall be surprised, if he can tell a true
friend from a deceiver.

unctum: Ep. 1. 15, 44. ponere ‘serve up': Sat. 11. 2, 233
4, 143 6, 643 8, 91; Pers. 1. 53 calidum scis ponere sumen.

423. levi ‘of little credit’=levz'fide.· the word has no reser-
ence here to moral character. But as this use is rare of persons,
and as pauper is very seldom accompanied by an epithet, Geel
has ingeniously conjectured velit. Words like modo and domo
are frequently confused. Cp. Plaut. Most. 432 (Sonn. :417
