138 HORA TI EPISTULAE.

10. Albanis: the snow would naturally lie on the Alban hills
earlier than on the plain of the Campagna. bruma for winter
generally, as in Carm. IV. 7, 122, Ep. Ι. 11, 19 and osten. For
the greater srequency os frost and snow in ancient tirnes than at
present in the same latitudes cp. Ep. Ι. 3, 3. quod si: cp. Verg,
Aen. V. 64, praeterea si nona dim mortalibus almum Aurora
extulerit: Catull. XIV. 17 si luxerit ‘come dawn' (Ellis). So

Off. 11. 6, 22, Plaut. Capt. 248, etc.

11. vates tuus, i.e. the humble friend whom you honour
with the exalted title of ‘bard⁷: cp. Carm. Ι. 1, 35 quodsi me
lyricis vatibus inseres, ΙΙ. 6, 24 vatis amici etc. L. Miiller De
Re Matrica p. 65 ff. shows how this old-sashioned name fell
into contempt in the early Latin poetry‚ and regained all its
earlier honour with Vergil (eg. Ecl. ΙΧ. 34). Cp. Munro on
Lucret. Ι. 102: Ep. ΙΙ. 1, 26.

12. contractus ‘huddled up’, ἐπικεκυφώς as in Lucian
Saturn. 9, 9 ἐπικεκυφότες...ἀμφὶ τὴν κάμινον. Others take it as
‘in retirement': cp. V erg. Moret. 77 quis enim contractior illo?
Senec. de Tranq. An. 9 habitare contractius ; others again com-
pare velis conlractis, and translate ‘ quietly'.

the sign that spring had arrived: cp. Ov. Fast. 11. 853 veris
praenuntia venit hirundo: Cic. ad Att. x. 2 λαλαγεῦσα iam

’χελιδὼν ἤδη μέμβλωκεν χώ χαρίεις Ζέφυροςε Ar. Eq. 419 ὥρα νέα,
χελιδών. Hesiod represents the song of the nightingale as com-
mencing after the rising of Arcturus, i.e. sixty days after the
winter solstice (Op. et Di. 568).

meet you wortln‘ly.

14. Calaber: the name is chosen only to make the story
