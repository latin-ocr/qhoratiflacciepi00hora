308 HORA Τ] EPISTULAE.

‘when lights are first lit'. But I doubt whether it means more
than ‘lil· e well· matched gladiators, whose protracted struggle
lasts till the darkness of evening puts an end to it’ Horace
humorously represents the stock of poems which they bring and
alternately inflict upon each other, drawing out mutual compli-
ments, but really inflicting painsul weariness, as inexhaustible.
Pers. 1V. 4² caedimus inque vicem praebemus crura sagittis

imitates the turn of the expression, but in a different con-
nexion.

99. discedo ‘Icome off’ from the contest, as in Sat. Ι. 7, 17.
Prof. Palmer suggests that this use corresponds to the laudatory
abi of v. 205. Alcaeus Ep. 1. 19, 293 Carm. 11. 13, 26 ff.

puncto ‘vote'. When by the Lex Gabinia of Β. C. 139 the
ballot had been introduced in the election of magistrates, it was
the custom sor the voting- tablets to be distributed by mgatmes:
these were then markedb by the votels, and placed in culae,
from which they were taken out and sorted by di'ffmbztm es. That
these then reported the results to certain custodes, who (as
Maeleane says) were ‘appointed to take the votes and prick off
the number given sor each candidate’‚ is a very doubtful in-
serence srom Cic. in Pis. 15, 36 vos rogatores, vos diribitores, vos
custodes faisse tabulalum. It is more probable that the ιίὶή-
bito) ω· reported diiectly to the presiding magistrate, who declared
the electi0n3 and that Cicero simply means that the senators
show ed such interest in his case that they took charge afterwards
of the voting-tablets for sear of fraud. yThe passage in the text
shows plainly that the punctum cannot have been used merely
to record a vote already given. On the other hand, the voting-
tablet itself was probably given out blank, and marked by the
voter with the initials of the candidate for whom he voted: at
least this seems the only explanation of the phrase of Cicero de
Dom. 43, 112 postea quam intellexit posse se...cz L. Pisone con-
sule praetorem renuntiari, si modo eadem prima lz‘lera competito—
rem habuisset aliquem, a condition which would have lest an
opening for fraud. We must then suppose (with Prof. Ramsay
Rom. Ant. p. 109) that the term punctum sor a vote was re-
tained from the days of viva voce voting‚ when the rogatores
would ask each voter, as he passed along the ponles for whom
he voted, and record the answer by pricking a tablet. So we
still retain the term ‘polling booth’ even under the ballot.
Punctum is used for ‘vote’ similarly in A. P. 343, Cic. pro
Plane. 22, 53 non nullas [tribus tulerunt] punctis palene totidem,
pro Mur. 34, 72 recordor qnantum..‚pandoram nobis detraxerint
<where Long misunderstands the meaning of the words of Festus
5. v. szffvgalores: cp. Miiller's note).

100. adposcere ‘to demand in addition'‚ only found else·
where in Ter. Haut. 838. See Postgate's remark above.
