178 ΗΘΚΛ Τ] EPISTULAE.

18-30, Yon care only for the low sensual pleasures of tlze
town ,· and bate hard work.

18. muamus, Ep. 1. 6, 9. disconvenit, Ep. 1. 1, 99.

19. tesqua ‘ wilds'. The scholiasts say that this was a
Sabine word; it seems to have no extant cognates‚ except perhaps
in the Sanskrit lule'k'lza (phonetically equivalent to tuska) ‘ empty’.
Cp. Vanicek p. 315. Lucan Phars. VI. 41 has saltus nemorosaque
tesca: otherwise the word is found only in archaic writers. T esca
is coupled with templum in the augurial formula quoted by Varro,
L. L. VII. 8. Horace probably uses a colloquial term suitable to
the supposed speaker. ·

20. amoena: Ep. 1. 16, 15·

21. fornix ‘brothel', originally an arched vault: Juv. 111.
156, XI. 171.

uncta ‘ greasy’. Orelli prefers the explanation of the Comm.
Cruq. ‘nidore redolens, et optimis cibis plena’; because Horace
elsewhere uses the word in the sense of ‘luxurious' or ‘rich’:
Ep. 1. 15, 443 17, 12. But here some contempt is evidently
implied: cp. Sat. 11. 2, 62 quaecunque immundis fervent allata
popinis. The popina ‘cook-shop’ was a place of low resort: the
form of the word points probably to a Campaniam, not a Greek
origin, as Lewis and Short suppose. It would regularly corre-
spond in Oscan to a Latin coquina, only found in late writers.
Cp. Curtius Gr. Etym. 11. 65.

22. incutiunt ‘inspire'; more commonly with melum, ti-
morem and the like: but cp. Lucret. Ι. 19 omnibus incutiens
blandum per pectora amorem.

23. ang-ulus iste, a contemptuous term used by the vilicus,
as we might say ‘hole and corner'. Pepper and frankincense of
course did not grow in Italy at all; Horace nowhere speaks of
wine as produced on his own estate (cp. Ep. 1. 16, Carm. 11. 18,
14): the vile Sabinum of Carm. 1. 20 may have been bought in
the dolium and only bottled by Horace. This is better than to
assume that the wine, good enough to put before Maecenas, did
not deserve to be called wine in the opinion of the vilicus.

uvazqmzm uvam. All the good MSS· of Horace give tus,
wherever the word occurs: hence we cannot with Orelli defend
tlzus, on the strength of two inscriptions of the time of Augustus,
which have thurarii.

24. taberna. The villa of Horace was some three or four
miles from the nearest high mad, which might be expected to be
supplied with tabernae diversoriae. Orelli quotes from Varro de
Re Rust. Ι. 2, 23 si ager secundum viam et opportunus viatoribus
lotus, aedificandae tabernae dz‘versorz'ae, quae smzt...fructu0sae.
