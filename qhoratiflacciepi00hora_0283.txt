Bk. 11. Ep. 1.] NOTES. 247

Satires: in this very Epistle (v. 250) it evidently includes the
Epistles. Hence if, as we shall see reason to believe, the second
and third Epistle of this book (the latter the so-called Ars
Poetica) were written before the first, they may well have been
the Sermones mentioned by Suetonius. The answer to the
second is that Horace himself in v. 4 apologises sor the brevity of
this poem, and the sportive protest of Augustus is a reply to
this apology. Hence there is no valid reason sor rejecting the
express testimony of Suetonius. Mommsen (Ha-mes xv. 105)
believes that the Epistles of the first book are the sermones
quidam, and that, though they must, as he admits, have been
published some time previously, the slightness of the acquaint-
ance between Horace and the Emperor before the publication of
the Carmen saeculare prevented the latter from having any
knowledge of them. It seems to me very doubtful whether
Mommsen is right in limiting the intimacy of Augustus with
Horace so completely to the last few years of his lise.

This Epistle has always been a favourite one. It contains a
great deal of shrewd criticism with some of those happy auto-
biographical touches, which Horace knew so well how to throw
in. Mommsen indeed (Hermes xv. 103) calls these three
Epistles ‘the most graceful and delightful works in all Roman
literature ’-

1-4. Witlz all tlze claz'ms upon your time, Caesar, I should
be unpatriotic‚ if I were to acldress you at length.

1. solus: Augustus did not lose the support of Agrippa
until B.C. 12, but since B.C. 17 he had been in the East‚ return-
ing to Rome this year, about the same time as Augustus re-
turned from Gaul. But Horace is speaking of the responsibility
of empire ; and with a natural license.

2. moribus. The position which Augustus assumed as a
‘saviour of society’ and reformer of morals is often dwelt upon
by the poets of his time, and is admirably described by M. Gaston
Boissier in his Religion Romame, vol. Ι. 67—- 108. Cp. Mommsen,
Staatsr. 11². 686 note 1. With moribus the scholiast rightly sup-
plies suis not tuz's .· for the combination of mores and lega-s
cp. Carm. 111. 24, 35 quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?

4. morer tua. tempora ‘ waste your time’: just as we have
in Ep. Ι. 13, 17 oculos auresque morari, ‘to make eyes and ears
dwell upon a thing', so here the tempora, the time which
Augustus had at his command for important business, is repre-
sented as in danger of being taken up with Horace⁷s poetry.
The plural tempora in prose always seems to carry with it sorne—
thing of the force of καιροί ‘opportunities’ for doing anything‚
n10t,rnerely the lapse of time: thus often=‘crisis’, ‘emergen-
cies . -
