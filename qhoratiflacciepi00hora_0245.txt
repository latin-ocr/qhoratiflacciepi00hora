Bk. 1. Ep. xva] NOTES. 209

quadra, not, 1 think, ‘the morsel’, but as in Verg. Aen. ΠΙ.
115: cp. Mayor on Juv. v ο and Athen. ΙΙΙ. p. 114c (quoted
there) αρτους.. ,οὓς Ῥωμαῖοι κοδράτους λέγουσιν.

50. corvus: the reference cannot be to the familiar sable of
the crow and the sox (Phaedr. 1. 13, Babr. Lxxvrl), as Schiitz
thinks: in that there is no rixa, no invidia. Horace must
either have had an inaccurate remembrance of the story, or have
been thinking of quite a different one, in which the crow by the
noise which it made over some booty which it had discovered
attracted others to claim a share in it.

52. Brundisium might bc visited by the patron sor busi-
ness or on state· affairs, as by Maecenas. cp. Sat. Ι. 5. Sur-
rentum for pleasure: it was especially famous sor its mild and
salubrious climate, Stat. Silv. 11. 2, Sil. Ital. v. 466 Zephsto
S ur7 cutum molle salubrz.

53. salebras=asperitales itineris Acron. So used by Mart.
IX. 58, 5 quae Flaminiam secant salebrae. The roads to Brun—
disium and Surrentum were among the best' m Italy

55. refert· ‘repeats' i.e. imitates: cp. Ep. 1. 18, 6-, Tac.
Ann. Ι. 26 easdem artes D) usum rettulisse: Cic. Cluent. 31, 86
te illud zdem.. nunc rettulzsse deszror

catellam, evidently here a diminutive of catena, not of
catulus, as some have taken it3 comparing Mart. Ι. 110; 111 82, =
39; xxv. 198, Prop. 111. (1v.) 3, 55, Juv. VI. 654- The chain
is a more natural accompaniment of the peri'scelzs than the
favourite dog, and besides can be more easily replaced by the
lov er' s generosity‚ which' rs to be awakened by the complaint-

58. triv-11³, chosen by the impostor as the scene of his acci-
dent, because there would there be most passers-by.

59. planum: a Greek word (cp. Ev. Matth. xxvii. 63
ἐκεῖνος ὁ πλάνος effi-eu ἔτι ζῶν), used also by Cic. Cluent. 26, 72
ille planus improbissimus. It is better to have a full stop after
planum, rather than a comma, as some editors have.

60. dicat: an asyndeton: ‘though he says'. Osifim: the
worship of the Egyptian deities was at this time much on the
increase at Rome, so that Augustus (Dio Cass. L111. 2) did not
allow their rites within the city. Cp. Eoissier Relzgrion Romaz'ne
1. 334 ff„ Marquardt Handb. 111. 71. The people looked upon
them with great awe (Val. Max. 1. 3, 3); and hence the oath
of the impostor. To suppose, as most editors d0, that the
man was himself an Egyptian, and swore by his country’s
deities, would be to assume that his distress was not only in
this instance genuine, but also bore the evident stamp of
genuineness.
