354 Ales POETJCA.

tum enlm supra prosam orationem, quam pedestrem Graeci vocant,
surgit [Plato] Photius quotes from Aristoph. [Fr. 713 D.] παῦσαι
μελῳδοῦσ’ ἀλλὰ πεζῆ μοι φράσους and Plato Soph. 237A has
πεζῆ τε ὦδε ἑκάστοτε λέγων καὶ μετὰ μέτρων. This use of the
word is very common in later Greek.

96. Telephus was the son of Hercules by Auge, daughter of
the king of Tegea. At his birth he was exposed on Mount
Parthenius, and his mother fied for refuge to Teuthras, king of
Mysia, who being childless adopted her as his daughter. When
Telephus was grown up, he went forth in search of his mother,
and arrived at Mysia, at a time when Idas was endeavouring to
expel Teuthras from his throne. Telephus having defeated Idas
was offered by Teuthras the hand of Auge, and the succession
to the throne: but their relationship was discovered before the
marriage took place. XVhen the Greeks were on their way to
Troy, Telephus was king of Mysia, and being married to a
daughter (or sister) of Priam he drove them back, but stumbling
over a vine, he was wounded by Achilles. The wound could
not be cured until in pitiful guise he went to Agamemnon, and
monitu Chstaemuestrae Orestem infantem de cunabulis rapuit,
minimus se cum occisurum, uisi sibi Achivi mederemur (Hygin.
Fab. CL). Achilles was prevailed upon to cure him with the
rust of the spear which had inflicted the wound. Plays were
written upon this story by Aeschylus, Sophocles Euripides,
Agathou, Ennius and Accius. Sophocles in his ‘Telephus or
the Mysians‘ (cp. Frag. 358—368, 510 D.) dealt with the former
part of the legend: but Euripides, in a play of which we have
some 30 fragments preserved, mainly through the scholiast's
notes on the merciless parodies by Aristophanes (cp. Fragm.
697—727 Dind.)‚ treated the latter part, representing Telephus
in the greatest misery. For the plays of Ennius and Accius
based upon this cp. Ribbeck Ram. Trag. pp. 104 f.‚ 344 f. ¹

Peleus was banished from Aegina by his father Aeacus sor
the murder of his half-brother Phocus, and fied to Phthia, where
he was received and purified by Eurytion, who gave him his
daughter Antigone in marriage, and a third of his kingdom. In
the hunt of the Calydonian boar Peleus killed Eurytion by
accident, and fied to Iolcus, where he was again purified by
Acastus. Here Astydameia [or Hippolyte Carm. ΠΙ. 7, 18],
wife of Acastus, fell in love with him, and when her love was
rejected, accused him to Acastus, as Hippolytus and Bellerophon
were accused under like circumstances. Acastusjn revenge lest
him asleep on Mt Pelion, aster taking away his sword, that he
might be a prey to the beasts. Peleus on awakening was attacked ⁷
by Centaurs‚ but saved by Chiron. Then followed his famous
marriage with Thetis. Asterwards Peleus gathering an army be—
sieged Acastus in Iolcus‚ and slew Astydarneia. For the numerous
