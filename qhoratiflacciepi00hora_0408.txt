peacesul close, and calm the minds excited and disturbed with
the cammities, and still more the apparent injustices‚ suffered by
the actors' (Mahaffy Euripides, p. 122). In the Philoctetes of
Sophocles the appearance of Heracles ex machina is needful in
order that the struggle between two human wills‚ neither of
which could yield without an inconsistency fatal to the dramatic
picture, might be terminated by an expression of the divine will.
In some at least of the plays of Euripides there is also ‘dignus
vindice nodus', an entanglement that calls for a deliverer.

192, quana...persona. Tragedy began with a dialogue
between a single actor and the leader of the chorus; Aeschylus
introduced asecond actor, Sophocles a third (Arist. Poet. 1v. 16
καὶ τό τε τῶν ὑποκριτῶν πλῆθος ἐξ ἑνὸς εἰς δύο πρῶτος Αἴσχυλοῒ
ἤγαγε,..τρεῑς δὲ καὶ σκηνογραφίαν Σοφοκλῆς), employed also by
Aeschylus in his later plays, i.e. in the trilogy of the Orestea
(probably not in the Prometheus). These three actors formed a
troop, and one troop was assigned by the archon to an approved
dramatist. Ifit was necessary for some words to be said by a
fourth character, when the three actors were already on the stage,
these were spoken by one of the chorus as a παρασκήνιον or
παραχορὴγημα (cp. 772 alm: of tlzc GweAs, p 268) It has been
supposed that the Oedipus Coloneus required a fourth actor, but
there is no difficulty in supposing that the part of Theseus was
divided between the second and the third actors, the former
taking all except vv. 886—1043‚ and that in the latter part of
the play the few words spol en by Ismene were treated as a πα-
ρασκήνιον (cp. Campbell s Sophocles Ι.2 p. 284, or Schneidewin' s
Ez'nlez'tung ad fin..) In the Andromache of Euripides 545ff.
while Andromache, her young son Molossus and Menelaus are
still upon the stage, Peleus enters: but the speeches assigned to
Molossus are few and brief, and were probably spoken for him by
one of the chorus concealed. In the Choeplzm' ι of Aeschylus the
three lines (900—902 ) which form the whole part of Pylades,
were spoken by the actor who was also the οἰκέτης, as the Schol-
says ἰνα μή δ’ λέγωσιν. Hence there is no real exception to this

law' in the Greek tragedians. Of course mute cha1acteis were
freely introduced.

loqui laboret ‘push in his words ’ so as to distract the atten-
