NOTES. 349

68. facta is not osten used sor opem, perhaps never in
prose: but Ovid Her. X 60 has non hommum visco, non ε( o
fizcta boum, where the last words translate ἔργα βοῶνε so that
Bentley’ s substitution os cuncto is needless.

69. nedum—stet, Roby δ 1658, S. G. ἓ 688. Key’ 5 notion
(L. G. ἓ 1228), that cxislumes is omitted sor the sake of brevity,
will not stand examination. But in cases like the present Mr
Roby’s way of stating the usage needs to be rnodified or rather
inverted : the ‘greater event', i.e. the perishing of all works of
men, is rhetorically regarded as having sor its purpose the pre·
vention of the ‘less event’, the continued eurreney of words.

sermonum, a very rare, perhaps unparalleled use os the plural,
for ‘style’ or ‘language’. Carm. 111. 8, 5 docte sermones utrius-
que linguae is quite different, if the usual interpretation is correct.

⁷0. multa renascentur: archaisms were much affected by
the writers of the second century after Christ, such as Fronto,
A. Gellius, and Apuleius. Our own time has similarly wit-
nessed a great revival of archaic words in poetry.

72. ‘arbitrium quod statuimus nulla causa allata; ius
facultas quam ceteri ultro agnoscunt: norma. regula a nobis
praescripta cui ceteri obtemperant’ Orell. penes personifies
usus‘ in whose hands’. Cp. Ep. ΙΙ. 2, 119.

73—309. In this second main section of the poem Horace
applies his general principles to the treatment of different kinds
of poetry, passing from one to the other with little sormalsty,
but dwelling mainly upon the drama.

73—85. Homer first an ote Ιιεχαηῑιί erw, then followed elegzac
verse of uncertazqz orzgm: i'ambzcs wele invented by Archilochus
χόν lzz's lampnons, and adopted both by comedy and lragedy. Lyrz'c
verse is filled for hymns, sor odes qf victmy, andsor songs about
love and wine.

¹14. Homerus: the invention of the hexameter was ascribed
to the Delphie priestS‚ and it is no improbable conjecture that
the earliest epie poetry—which in any ease must have existed
for centuries before the Iliad assumed its present form—was of
purely religious origin. Cp. Mahasfy’s G7eek Lzlenzture, Ι. pp.
15—17. The hexameter ar,ose as may be seen from the irn-
portance of the caesura, from a combination of two short lines,
the first normally -νν Ι —vv Ι -, 1116 second the same in struc-
ture but with an anacrusis, and an added syllable at the end
— l -vv Ι —vv i — H —. From this the pentameter was formed
by the omission of the added 61611161115111 the second half. Thus
the character of the verse was entirely changed. Cp. Cole-
ridge’ s version of Schiller' s lines.
