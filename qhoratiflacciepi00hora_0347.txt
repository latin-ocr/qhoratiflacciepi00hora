forth by publicati0n; and accounts for the unusual expression by
saying that the poet is regarded as the keeper of a shrine. He
·thinks the point to be that the poet is to exercise a severe criti-
cism upon his writings before entrusting them to the general
judgment. But it is doubtful whether pcuclralz'a Vestae could
thus be used of a private house, even though there was usually an
altar to Vesta on the hearth. Besides this separates the words too
much in thought from invita recedam& it is better to render
⁴ although they may be reluctant to retire‚ and may still cling to
the sanctuary of Vesta's sane’. In the temple of Vesta there
were certain mysterious objects‚ accessible only to the Vestals
and the Pontiffs‚ and carefully kept from the eyes of the multi—
tude: they were kept in the penus interior or penelrale os the
temple, shut up in earthen vessels, and were regarded as the
pignora imperii (Liv. XXVI. 27, Ovid, Fast. VI. 359, 439). The
most famous among these was the Palladium: but there were
also other divine figures (especially os the Penates) and mystic
emblems. (Preller, Rijm. Myth. p. 543). Keller interprets
‘although they may be phrases hallowed by antiquity, which it
seems profanation to touch '. Macleane's paraphrase ‘the verses
though they may be expunged, still are kept in the author's desk,
because he has a regard for them and cannot make up his mind
to destroy them’ is quite impossible. Orelli thinks the point to
be ‘ although you' may plead that, as they are not yet pnblished
you need not be so severe with them ’. The only difficulty in the
way of the interpretation proposed above (which does not differ
much from Ritter⁷s) is that there is no positive evidence that the
temple of Vestahad the privileges of an asylum. But the notion
of a sacred protection was always associated with the Vestal
Virgins: if they met a condemned criminal in the street he was
set free3 and their intercession carried the greatest weight.
(Preller, p. 540). Hence it is not too much to assume that those
in danger might have recourse to the temple for at least tempo-
rary protection. So Conington,

‘And cling and cling like suppliant to a shrine'.

115. populo τ the rhythm and the sense alike require this to
be connected with obscurata, not with bonus, which can well
stand alone, nor with eruet, which would make the taste of the
people, which Horace elsewhere scorns, that which he desires to
gratify.

quae parum splendoris habent. Cp. Quint. 1. 5, 3 licet enim dicri-

mentioned by Cic. Brut. 15, 57 as the first quem extet et de quo
