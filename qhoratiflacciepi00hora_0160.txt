has similarly invz'deor in A. P. 56. The idiom is a colloquial one.

Ι think Orelli is wrong in supposing idoneus as well as imperor
to be connected with procurare.

22. turpe=worn and faded. toral, ‘coverlet ’ placed upon
the tori, as in Petron. 40 advenerunt ministri ac toralia proposue-
ggssytogrssvj4 cp. Sat. 11. 4, 84. For the form cp. capital, cervical,

23. corruget naris ‘make you turn up your nose ’ in dis-

gust. Quint. XI. 3, 80 names this among other movements of
the nose and lips which he considers indecorous.

ne non...ostenda†. ‘ that...sail not to show you ’.

25. eliminet ‘ carry abroad ’, a word used in the early poets in a
literal sense, and here in a somewhat more extended application :
cp. Pomponius in Non. p. 38 vos istic manete.- eliminabo extra
aedes coniugem, and other dramatists there quoted, and Quint.
VIII. 3, 31 nam memini iuvenis admodum inter Pomponium et
Senecam etiam praefationibus esse tractatum an ⁴ gradus eliminat '
in tragoedia dici oportuisset. The force of the English derivative
seems to be due to inathematicians of a later age. Cp. the

quotation in Mart. 1. 27, 7 (probably from some drinking song)
μισω μνάμονα συμπόταν.

26. iungaturque pari: for as Seneca (Ep. XIX.) says, ante
conspiciendum cum quibus edas et bibas, quam quid edas et bibas.
Butram...septiciumque‚ quite unknown persons, although the
names are found elsewhere, the former in an inscription (of
doubtful genuineness), the latter several times both in inscriptions
and in literature. Bentley first restored the true forms sor the
corrupt Brutum...Srsslz'mimnqna Orelli is too hard upon them
in comparing them with Mulvius et scurrae of Sat. 11. 7, 365

27. cena prior, ‘ an earlier engagement ': potiorque puella ‘ a
girl whom he presers’: -qzte appears here to have the force of
coupling ahernatives, which are regarded as both acting to pre-
vent his presence, though not together: hence it is virtually dis-
junctive, as in Verg.Georg.11. 87, 139, 312, 111. 121 (Conington),
and often in Lucretius (cp. Munro's index): the engagement is
not necessarily to the puella, though it may be. Martin rightly
renders ‘unless he be engaged elsewhere or flirting with some
girl whom he prefers to any company’.

28. adsumam, ‘ I will have S. too ἐ it is a striking proof os
the mechanical and careless way in which our MSS. were copied,
that Keller quotes only one as having this, the unquestionably

correct reading: all his others have acl summam, or some cor-
ruption ot‘ that reading.
