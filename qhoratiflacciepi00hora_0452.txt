416 ΑΕΒ POETJCA.

ambitiosa=supe7flua‚ according to the scholiasts like luxuri-
antia of Ep. ΙΙ. 2, 122 : perhaps rather ‘pretentious'3 cp.
Quint. Ι. 2, 27 si ambitiosis ulilt‘a praeferet: XII. 10, 40 affictatio
et ambitiosa in loquendo z'aclautia.

448. parum claris. Horace like Vergil is singularly free
from the affected obscurity of the imitators of the Alexandrian
literature. Cp. Nettleship's Life of Vergil pp. xxii„ xxiii. Sueton.
vit. Hor. p. 298 Roth.

449. arg-uer ‘will point out’: the meaning of ‘censure’ as
applied to things seems to be somewhat later.

450. Aristarchus, the great Alexandrian critic, who did so
much to establish the text of Homer in the middle of the second
century B.C. His merits were first shown by the publication of
the Venetian Scholia on Homer by Villoison in 1788. They
have been discussed best by F. A. Wolf in his famous Prolegomena‚
by Lehrs dc] Aristarchi Studiis Homericis (ed. 3, 1882), and by
Pierron in his edition of the Iliad. There is no reason to suppose
that he was unduly severe, though he was strict in his critical
principles. Pope (Dunciad lv. 203) calls Bentley ‘that awful
Aristarch’, in a passage which does infinite injustice to one who
was among the freshest and most vigorous of writers, as well as
in the foremost rank of our scholars. Cicero ad Att. 1. 14, 3 meis
orationibus, quarum tu Aristarchus es.

451. nugae ‘trifling faults'.

452. derisum exceptumque sinistre ‘flattered and treated
uncandidly ⁷, as Mr Yonge rightly takes it.

453—476. A poet is as clangamus as a man witlz an infictious

reczlatzons.

453. morbus regius: Celsus 111. 24 derives this name for
the jaundice from the costly remedies which had to be applied,
which were only within the reach of the wealthy (rogam per
omne tempus utendum est exercitatzbne‚ frictione...lecto etiam et
conclavz¹ cullz'ore, lusu, ioco, ludis, lascivia, per quae mens
exhilaretur, ob qnae regius morbus dictus videtur. Pliny says
(XXII. 24, 1 14) Varro regium cognominatum arquatorum morbum
tradit, quoniam mulso curetur, which, Ι suppose, comes to much
the same thing. The other name sor it morbus arqualus is still
more obscure: the explanation of Celsus that it is so called
because the yellowish tinge caused by it reminds one of the
colour of the rainbow (arcus caelestis) is not very satisfactory.
Jaundice is not at all contagious: perhaps the notion that it was
arose from the depression of spirits caused by it.

454. fanaticus error, properly a frenzy inspired by (the
