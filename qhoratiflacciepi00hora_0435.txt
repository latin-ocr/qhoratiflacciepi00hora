Horace, p. 121, Preller Gr. lllfllz. 1. 484. The name is doubt-
less derived from λάμος (ηἰακνᾎ with which is connected
λάμιαεχάσματα. In Apul. Met. 1. 17, v. 11 the word is simply
one of abuse=‘old witches'. The vampire Lamia, who appears
in Keats‘s poem, is of later origin. extrahat, i.e. describe how
it is drawn: cp. ‘221 (note).

341. centuriae seniorum, consisting, in each division of the
Servian classificatmn, of those who were over 45 years of age.
These older men cared nothing sor plays which had no usel’ul
Iessons in them. “

342. Eamne-⁹», the first of the three original centuries of
knights, the other two being Tities and Luceres (Liv. 1. 13).
Much difficulty has been found in understanding why Ramnes
should be used here to denote the younger part of the audience.
But the term seems only to have been used of the knights equo
publico, who served as cavalry, not of those who belonged to the
ordo equester by virtue of their census3 and the period of service
for cavalry was limited to ten campaigns, so that all these equites
would be under 30. Hence Q. Cicero de pet. cons. 8, 33 de-
scribes them as illa adulescenlulm‘um actas, Liv. ΙΙ. 13 as proceres
iuvmlutz's, while he makes Perseus speak of them as equites
seminarium senatus (XLII. 61). There is no special reason why
Ramnes should have been chosen, rather than one of the other
centuries. Cp. Madvig Vers. u. Verw. 1. 161—2. cels1=
‘haughty’, whether we take it as an epithet, or as an adverbial
predicate with praetereunt, cp. Liv. V11. 16 celsi et feroces z'n
proelium vadunt, and Cic. de Orat. Ι. 40, 184 (note).

343. punctum: Ep. 11. 2, 99 (note).

345. Sosiis: Ep. Ι. 20, 2. The question has been raised
whether an author· received anything directly from his publisher;
it seems clear that he did, at least in the time os Seneca (de
Benev. VII. 6) and Martial (XI. 108): cp. Becker Gallusss 11.
389 f. If the demand was good, the publisher would be able to
make a good profit: Mart. Xiv. 194 (on Lucan) sunt quidam qui
me ‹lz‘cunt non esse poetam ,· sed qzcz' me vendit, bibliopola putat.

mare transit: here just in the opposite sense to Ep. 1. 20,
13 (cp. note). Martial was read in Gaul, Spain and Britain, and
complains that he gets no profit from his British readers (XI. 3,
6). Pliny Ep. 1X. 11 is delighted to find that his works have a

good sale at Lugdunum.

346. longum prorogat ‘extends to a distant day', proleptic:
as Soph. Traeh. 679 μείζον’ ἐκτενῶ λόγον. Schiitz connects
longmn noto ‘known to distant parts ⁷, not so well.

34⁷. ignovisse: v. 98 (note). Just as the string of a ly're

may give the wrong note, or a bow miss its mark, so a man can-
not always produce the result at which he aims.
