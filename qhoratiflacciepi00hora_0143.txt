his real sentiments in favour of moderafion, but in a humorous
half-serious fashion. ‘ 1 have said my say: if you lag behind
in the race, or are fired with an enthusiasm, which carries you on
abead of all others, in neither case can you expect my company :
I go on the even tenor of my way, waiting sor no one, and trend-
ing on no one’s heels.’ The happy turn thus given to the con-
clusion will not escape the notice of any one, who is not con-
tented with the explanation that Horace ‘gets rather prosy
sometimes, and thinks it is time to stop '. anteis : Carm. 1. 35,

EPISTLE 111.

The date of this Epistle is clearly fixed hy line 1, to B.c. 20.
Julius Florus⁷ to whom it is addressed, was one of the comites of
Tiberius Claudius in his mission to the East‚ when he was
sent by Augustus to place Tigranes on the throne of Armenia
in the room of Artagrias, who had been murdered by his
own subjects (Merivale IV. 175, last ed.). According to Por-
phyrio, Florus wrote satires‚ ‘ among them some selected from
Ennius, Lucilius and Varro '‚ by which is meant doubtless that he
re-wrote some of the poenis of th'ese earlier authors, adopting
them to the taste of his own day, much as Pope and Dryden
re-wrote Chaucer's tales. The second Epistle of Book ΙΙ. is also
addressed to him—This epistle gives us a pleasant conception os
the literary tastes os the young nobles whom Tiberius had
gathered round him in his suite (cp. Ep. lx. 4), and a charming
picture of the relations of Horace, now in his 45th year, with the
younger aspirants to poetic farne, in its tone of kindly ad-
morntion.
