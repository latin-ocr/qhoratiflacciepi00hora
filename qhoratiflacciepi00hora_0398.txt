138. feret ‘produce’: hiatu ‘ mouthing'.

139. parturient is the reading supported by the evidence
of all Keller's MSS. of any value, and by citations of Probus,
Servius and Jerome. Bentley justly urged that verbs in —urio‚
‘quae meditativa recte vocant graminatiei’, have even in the pre-
sent a future soree: ‘parturio perinde est ac si dicas, meditor
parere, inibi est ut pariam⁷. He therefore contends that partu-
rient cannot stand: ‘hoc est, olim meditabuntur parere: quando
erit, obsecro, ut mus iste nascatur? and reads parturiunt,
which many good editors have accepted. His argument would
be sound‚ if we gave to parturient simply a future sorce; but it
may fairly be defended, as parallel to incipies of v. 136 ‘if you
do begin SO‚ it will be a case of “Mountains in labour, and out
comes a mouse⁷''. This is perhaps better than to forsake the
MSS. and assume that parturiunt has been earelessly assimi-
lated to nascetur. Nonius p. 479 M. quotes esurz'bo from Pom-
ponius and Nonius, and Ter. Haut. 981 has esuritus-os.—The
expression was proverbial. Athenaeus XIV. 6, p. 616 d, says
that Tachos, the king of Egypt, insulted Agesilaus, who was of
smallnstaturffi by quoting ὤδινεν ὄρος, Ζεὺς δ’ ἐφοβεῖτο, τὸ δ’ ἔτε-
κεν μυν.

141. die-urbes Horace gives a compressed rendering of
the first three lines of the Odyssey (cp. Ep. 1. 2, 19):

”Ανδρα μοι ἔννεπε, Μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ.
πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον &repo-ey
πολλῶν δ’ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἕὝνω.

tempora may be defended by Troiana tempora testatus of
Carm. 1. 28, 11, and Ov. Met. X1. 757 Priamusque novissima
Troiae lempom sortitus. Bentley read with some inferior MSS.
moenia, suggesting also ficnera: the latter would be the better,
but no change is needed.

1453 cogitat ‘his plan is': speciosa. miracula ‘striking

145. Antiphaten, the king of the Laestrygonian cannibals
Odyss, Χ. 100 ff. Scyllamque, separated rather awkwardly
from Charybdim, with which Scylla is coupled in Od. X11. 87 ff.
as usually, by the mention of the Cyclops, whom Odysseus
encounters in Odyss. IX. 160 ff. Hence Bentley suggested Cir-
camque, which, like so many of his emendations, is perhaps
what Horace ought to have written, and certainly what he did
not write.

146. reditum—orditur, a compressed expression sor ‘nor
does he act like the writer who began etc.' Homer of course
himself says nothing about the return of Diomede. The scho-
