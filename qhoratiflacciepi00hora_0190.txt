154 ΗΘΚΛ Τ] EPISTULAE.

3. dissimiles: to take this (with Kr'uger) as ‘unlike him ’,
still referring to Horace alone, while gemelli is a true plural,

is very harsh. It is much better to punctuate more fully at
amatores.

at cetera has not so much support from the better MSS. as
adcete7*a,· but the latter is so evidently the grammatical correc-
tion of a copyist, who did not see the construction of cetera (⁶ as
to all other things'‚ as below in l. 503 cp. Carm. IV. 2, 60;
Verg. Aen. 111. 594 at cetera Graius) that all good recent editors
have without hesitation adopted it. The punctuation of these
lines is very uncertain. Bentley has amatores,·...dissimz'les.·...
animis .·—pariter.· columbi, Orelli amatores, . ..dissimiles‚ . ..animis
.. pariter...c0lumbi. Munro again amatores..dissimiles,...animis,
.. ‚pariter . solumbz', Kriiger amatores, . . ‚dissimiles :. . animis. . .
pariter...c0lumbi: Keller agrees with Munro's view, which is vir-
tually the same as Bentley's. It is clearly better (ῐ) to connect
dissimiles with gemelli rather than amatores, (2) to take columbi
with nidum servas rather than adnuimus. Orelli unnaturally refers
adnuimus to the action of the pigeons rostra amantissime conse-
rentes, which was called columbari. Translate ‘A lover of the
country, I send my greeting to Fuscus. a lover of the city. In
this one matter, to be sure, much unlike, but in all else all but
twins, with the hearts of brothers; whatever one denies, the
other denies too, and we assent alike: we are like a pair of
pigeons long attached and well known to each other, but you
keep your nest, I praise &c.'

paene, a much better orthography than pene, which Munro
prints here, apparently only by oversight. Cp. Carni. 11.. 13,
21; Sat. Ι. 2, 1015 5, 72; Ellendt on Cic. de Orat. 1. 3, 10.
C. I. L. 1.1009.

5. vetuli: Fuscus appears on intimate terms with Horace
in'Sat.'1.l9‚ which must have been written about 15 years before
th1s epist e.

7. circumlita. ‘overspread': the unusual expression for cir-
cumdala seems intended to suggest the smooth sostness of the
moss.

8. quid. quaeris? ‘in short ⁹, a very common phrase, espe-
cially in Cicero’s letters, when a writer drops details and makes
a general statement: cp. Cic. ad Att. 11. 1, 2 with Boot's note.
It is not quite as Orelli says ‘ultro tibi omnia dicam': but rather
‘ why ask about each point?’ The rendering in the Globe edi-
tion ⁴ dor you ask why?‘ is a very curious slip.

regno ⁴ 1 feel myselfa king‘.
