EPISTLE 11.

The Florus of this epistle is the Julius Florus to whom
Horace addressed the third epistle of the first book. Now, as
then, he appears attached to the suite of Tiberius Nero. But
while the date of the former epistle admits of being determined
precisely, it is less easy to fix the date of the present. Almost
every year between B. C. 20 and the death of Horace witnessed
some campaign or journey into the provinces on the part of
Tiberius, on any one of which Florus may have accompanied
him. There are only two considerations which help us to
decide. (1) Horace speaks very strongly of his entire aban-
donment of carmina, i.e. lyric poetry. This excludes the period
of the composition of the Carmen Saeculare and the odes of
the fourth book, i.e. B. C. 17—13. (2) The phrase accedente
senecta (v. 211) may have a reference to his own position at the
time. If so, this inclines us to go down as late as B.C. 12,
when Tiberius, aster holding the consulship in B.C. 13, was
governor of Illyricum, and quelled a revolt among the Pan-
nonian tribes. But as Horace speaks of himself aspraecanus in
B.C. 20 (Ep. Ι. 20, 24)3 and as Crassus in Cic. de Orat. ΙΙ.
4, 15 calls himself senex when only in his fiftieth year, we need
not lay much stress on this. The really decisive question is
whether it was possible for Horace, after the ‘Indian summer'
of his lyrical productiveness to return to the same position of
renunciation which he had taken up before it. Vahlen argues
that this was not possible, and therefore assigns the present
epistle to B.C. 18, when he thinks that Tiberius was absent in
Gallia Comata. But Mommsen shows that this absence fell in
B.C. 16, a date excluded by considerations previously noticed.
He therefore ascribes the letter to B.C. 19, in the autumn of
which year Tiberius returned with Angustus to Rome from the
East. Schiitz follows Vahlen: Ritter and Lucian Miiller adopt
the later date, Ritter even placing it as late as B.C. ιο. The
balance of evidence seems decidedly to incline in favour of the
earlier date. There is a great similarity of tone between this
epistle and the first of the first book. In both Horace pleads
that increasing years have left him no taste or power for lyric
poetry3 and make it a duty for him to study philosophy. Here
