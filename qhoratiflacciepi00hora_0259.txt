is more than can be said sor this blundering product of the xnh.

93. tepores has sar more authority than vapores, and the
nature of the evidence in favour of the former is such as to
exclude altogether Orelli’s notion that it may be a gloss on
vapores. Macleane stands, 1 think, quite alone among recent
editors in following Orelli. It is true, however, that lepor
generally denotes a mild warnith (cp. Lucret. 11. 857 calidum
tepidumque vaporem ‘heat moderate or violent' Mutuo), and the
earliest instance quoted sor the meaning of ‘severishness' is from
Ammianus XIX. 4, 2 tepore febrium arescunt.

nocturnos undoubtedly suggested the unlucky medio de nocte
to the medieval copyist.

94. nubem, a common metaphor‚ which we may retain in
translation: ‘banish the cloud from your brow'. Cp. Soph. Ant.

173 στυγνὸν δ’ὁφρύων νέφος αὑξάνεταιῑ Shakspere Ant. and Cleop.
111. 2, 52 ‘Wiu Caesar weep? He has a cloud in ’s sace’. Con-
ington's version ‘unknit your brow’ reminds us of Taming of the
Shrew V. 2, ‘unknit that unkind, threatening brow'.

95. obscuriz‘mysterious’ κρυψίνους. The modesty which
prompts to reserve osten makes a man appear to be disguising
his thoughts with a view to deceive. Cp. Cic. de Off. 111. 13, 57:
lzoc autem celandi grum-...non operti, non simplicis, non ingenui,
non iusti, non viri boni (est), versuti potius, obscuri, astuti, fol-
lacis, malitiosi, callidi, veteratoris, vafri.

98. Num—num: Bentley’s ne—ne, retained from the early
editions (perhaps only by oversight) has practically no authority.
Ritter and Schiitz join semper inops ‘never to be satisfied': it
seems better to regard agitet as a jussive subjunctive retained
from the direct question [Robyg 1612, S.G. ἓ 674 (h)] and to
translate ‘whether you are always to be tormented by a craving
that is unsatisfied’. There is no need sor study and instruction
before a man can leam whether he is tormented: his desire is to
know whether he will ever escape from his torment. Orelli is
nearly right with his ‘num te lucri et potentiae cupiditas, cui
