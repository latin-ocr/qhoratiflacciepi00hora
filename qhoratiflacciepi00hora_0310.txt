274 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

cosam z'n Romuli gentem seram. This is somewhat more accu-
rate than Horace, for ‘even during the Second Punic War
dramatic performances went on uninterruptedly, inasmueh as most
of Naevius’ works and one half of Plautus’ literary exertions
(though perhaps the less fertile half) fall into the time of this
war’ (Teuffel, Rom. Lit. Ι. p. 104). But perhaps it is better (with
Sch'utz) to connect quietus closely with post Punica bella, ‘en-
joying peace after the close of the Punic wars'.

163. Thespis, the traditional founder of the Attie tragedy:
cp. A. P. 276. Horace here neglects the chronological order, as
in Sat. Ι. 4, 1 Eupolis atque Cratinus Aristophanesque poetae.
Euripides could not have been brought into an hexameter verse,
at any rate in the nominative case.

164. temptavit rem ‘made the attempt’: rem is not, as
some editors suppose. the object of vertere, attracted out of its
place3 the construction is like that in Liv. Ι. 57, 2 temptata res
est, sz' capi Ardea posset, 11. 35, 4 temptata res est, sz‘ disicere rem
possent.

venere ‘translate’‚ without an object expressed.

165. placuit, sibi. Prof. Sellas admirably brings out iubis
Roman Poets of tlte Republic‚ chap. V.‚ the reasons for the satis-
saction found by the Romans in the drama: cp. especially p.
151 ε ‘ The popularity and power of Roman tragedy‚ during the
century preceding the downfall of the Republic, are to be
attributed chiefly to its didactic and oratorical force, to the
Roman bearing of the persons represented, to the ethical and
occasionally the political cast of the sentiments expressed by
them, and to the plain and vigorous style in which they are
enunciated ’. We have fragments more or less important from
119 tragedies of this period, covering 285 pages in Ribbeck‘s
edition.

166. spirat tragicum satis ‘has sufficient trag1c inspira-
tion ³: cp. Carm. lv. 3, 24 quod spiro et placet), si placeo, tuum
est: for the construction cp. Roby ξ 1096-7, S. G. ξ 461. Stat.
Silv. V. 3, 12 allum spirans.

feliciter audet refers apparently to the boldness of the
language, especially in Pacuvius and Accius. Cp. A. P. 56 ff.

167. inscite: the vet. Bland. with some inferior MSS. has
in scriplis, but with inscitiae as a correction. Bentley reads
inscitus, on the strength of Horaee⁷s preference sor an adjective
rather than an adverb in such caseS, pointing out at the same
time that this accounts better for z'n scriptis: but these arguments
do not warrant us in departing from the MSS. inscitia, ‘want
of skill', is not so strong a term as inscientia, ‘ignorance’: cp.
eie. de Orat. 1. 22, 99 (note).
