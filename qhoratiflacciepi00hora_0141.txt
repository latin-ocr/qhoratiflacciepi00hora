Bk. I. Ep. IL] NOTES. 105

60. cogitat ‘ means', osten so used by Cicero in his speeches,
as well as in lighter prose and verse.

51. sic: i.e. no more than.

52. tabula. being properly a plank, sometimes has picta
added, when it is used in the sense of ‘picture’, as in Plaut.
Men. 144 tabulam pictam in pariete, Ter. Eun. 584, but more
commonly the epithet is omitted.

fomenta: evidently the parallelism with paintings and music
requires that this should denote something which is a source of
enjoyment to the healffly, but not to the diseased. Hence any
reference to medicinal applications‚ such as is assumed by
Macleane, for instance, is quite out of place. Diintzer has shown
by a quotation from Seneca (de Provid. lv. 9 Quem specularia
semper ab afflatu vindicarunt, cuius pedes inter fomenta subinde
mutata tepuerunt, cuius cenationes subditus et parietibus circum-
fusus calor temperavit, lzunc levis aura non sine pericula stringet)
that warm wrappings sor the feet, analogous to our foot-mufss‚
were regarded asa luxury: but a man suffering froin the gout in
his feet would get little pleasure from them. Bentley’s podagrum
for podagram has but slight authority, and the change from the
sufferet to the disease is pleasing rather than otherwise.

54. sincerum in the primary sense of the word ‘ clean? [the
derivation given in Lewis and Short is not quite exact: cp.
Corssen 12. 376]. The connexion of the thought seems to be:
an unhealthy body or mind spoils everything, just as a foul
vessel turns any contents sour. Then Horace goes on to wa1n
Lollius against various diseases of the mind.

55-71. Pleasure is not worth tlze pain it brings: greed z‘s
never satisfied: envy is tlte zoorst af tormenls: anger is short-lived
madness, and z's followed by νιῑξνῖί,ι z't must be mastered, and tlzat
when one is young, and tlze tasle is easy, and tlte gain enduring.

56. voto dat. cp. Sat. 1. 1, 92, 106.

57. alterius never even in iambic verse has the ῐ (cp. Plaut.
Capt. 303), but this occurs once (in cretics) in Ter. Andr. διδ,
and in Enn. Sat. VI. p. 158 Vahl. Cp. Ritschl’s Opusc. 11. 694
and Cic. de Orat. 111. 47, 183, which shows that illius was a
daetyl in the ordinary pronunciation of his own time.

58. Siculi tyranni, proverbially cruel, especially Phalaris* of
Agrigentum, the Dionysii and Agathocles at Syracuse. Cp. Cic.
in Verr. v. 56 145 tulit illa quondam insula (Sicilia) multos et
crudeles tyrannos· Juv. VI. 486 Sicula non mitior aula.

59. irae: moderor in Classical Latin with dat.=curb, with
acc. govern, direct.
