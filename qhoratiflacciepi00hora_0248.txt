212 ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE.

cp. Juv. ΙΙ. 68, Mart. ΙΙ. 39, vi. 64, 43 Becker Gallus ΙΙΙ, 64-5)t
and some have found a reference to that practice here. But it is
more probable that discolor is used as in Pers. V. 32 Mille lto-v
minum specics ct rerum discolor usus, merely for ‘different'. Cp.
vitae color in Ep. Ι. 17, 23, Sat. 11. 1, 60.

distabit with dative as in Carm. IV. 9, 29 paulum sepultae
distat z'nertioe celata virtus: these instances show what the con-
struction is in Ep. Ι. 7, 23; 11. 1, 7²· So the dative follows
dissidens in Carm. 11. 2, 18; ιίιβένί in Sat. Ι. 4, 48, A. P. 236:
discrepat Carm. 1. 27, 5; Sat. Ι. 6, 92, 11. 3, 108; Ep. 11. 2,
1933 A.P. 152, 219. Some of these cases might be explained‘as
ablatives‚ but others cannot, and none need be so taken.

5. diversum etc. Translate ‘the opposite to this fault is
almost a greater fault'.

6. inconcinna: Ep. 1. 17, 29.

' 7. commendat, not sor commendare vult, but with a certain
1r0ny.

tonsa cute ‘with hair clipped to the skin’‚ the sign of an un-
skilsul barber, as intonsum was of one who put on old-sashioned
ways. There is no need to change the reading here to quoe cute
se intonsa comnzemhzt, as Doederlein suggests. But strictly
speaking tondere was used of cutting short per pectinem ‘ over a
comb' (cp. Plaut. capt. 265) and rodere of shaving close (cp.
Mart. ΙΙ. 27, 5 uon tondet, inquom, quid igitur facit? radit). In
Mart. XI. 11, 3 the tonsus minzkter is opposed to the comatus
afterwards in sashion: so in X. 98, 8 we have praesta de grege
sordidaque villo tonsos horridulos..filios subulci. Cp. Conington

or Jahn on Pers. 111. 54, where detonsa iuventus is the term ap-
plied to students of Stoicism.

8. dici mera: the reading before Bentley was mera dici.-
but it is very inelegant to have the fourth foot eomposed of a
single word, and that a spondeo. The rhythm however is not
uncommon in Lucretius, and occurs at least once in Vergil Aen.

VILEoz5, where6there is a pause after the pyrrhich. dum volt:
cp. p. 1. 19, 1 .

9. medium (Ξμέσον τι) vitiorum: cp. Aristotle’s definhion,
Eth. Nic. ΙΙ. 6. ἔστιν ἡ ἀρετὴ ἕξις προαιρετική, ἐν μεσότητι οὖσα.
τῇ πρὸς ἡμᾶς,..μεσότης δὲ δύο κακιῶν, τῆς μὲν καθ’ ὑπερβολὴν τῆς
δὲ κατ’ ἔλλειψιν. So Cic. de Off. Ι. 25, 89 uunquam enim
iratus qni accedet adpocnam mediocritatem illam tenebit, quae est
inter nimium et parum, qnae placet Pmyoeatctz'czs: cp. Brut. 40,
1493 Carm- ΙΙ. 10, 5 auream mediocritatem.

10—20. One man obseqm‘ously calches up liis patron's words,
-wlzile another wrangles about llze merest tristes.
