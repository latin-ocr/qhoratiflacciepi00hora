is no reason for ascribing to the critici-vm of Alexandria the cha-
racteristics of its poetry: on the contrary ‘from one point of view
the de Arte Poetica seems to bear an Alexandrian stamp: it con-
tains the neatly-formulated criticism of a refined, intelligent and
well-trained scholar, not that of a philosopher whose eye is set
upon great things’. The second is met, at least in part, by his
valuable suggestion that Horace is sometimes translating or para-
phrasing his Greek original, sometimes adding his own comments
in the way of limitation‚ expansion or illustration from con-
temporary lise and thought. With this qualification, there is no
reason why we should not accept the statement of Porphyrion.
1t is not necessary to assume that Horace borrowed from no
other sources: but Michaelis has sufficiently d1sproved the theories
which would derive a large part of this epistle from Democritus,
Crito, Plato (in his Phaedrus), or Aristotle. From Varro he may
have obtained something, but we have no means of determining
how much.

The epistle is certainly not a complete ‘Art of Poetry'. Some
important branches of the subject are omitted altogether: others
are discussed with a fulness quite disproportionate to their im-
portance. Itis sometimes difficult to trace the sequence of the
remarks; and digressions and repetitions appear to abound.
Many-attempts have been made to remedy a disorder, which
was supposed to have originated either in the unskilfulness of'
those who published, after Horace’s death, the fragmentary
drafts of a poem, to which his own revision would have given
unity and completeness, or else in the poet's own ‘habitual in-
dolence, which prevented his ever producing a complete work of
any length' (Macleane). But such attempts have had no real
basis to go upon: they have rarely satisfied any but their pro-
pounders: and each suggested rearrangement has been declared
by later critics to make matters only worse. It has been too
commonly overlooked that very probably Horace intentionally
avoided in this, as in other epistles‚ the appearance of a formal
regularity of treatment. The epistle, like the Satura, from
which it originated, was of the nature of a familiar chat, rather
than a set treatise, and precisely marked divisions and sub-
divisions were quite foreign to its nature. Still with the help
of Prof. Nettleship⁷s valuable suggestion as to the relation of the
poem to its Greek source, we may find in it traces of an orderly
though not strictly systematic arrangement of subjects.

The epistle may be divided into three main sections. In the

* first (1—72) the poet is enjoined to look to the unity of his style
and conception, and to avoid all that is out of keeping. In the
‘second (73—288) these general principles are applied to the
variouskinds os poetry, and especially to the drama, which is
disonssed at length. In the third (289—476) the manifold re-
quisites for a successful cultivation of poetry are dwelt upon, and
