scilicet artium quas aut Parrhasius protulit aul Scopas. So in
Soph. O. C. 472 κρατῆρές εἰσιν ἀνδρός εὔχειρος τέχνη.

18. suspice, opp. of despice. colores, ‘dyes’‚ i.e. vestes
purpureas.

19. loquentem, very rarely used, as the context requires that
we should understand it here, of public speaking ς· which is almost
always dicere, opposed to conver-sational talk (loqm'): cp. Cic.
Orat. 3²› 113 nec idem loqui est quod dicere: de Orat. 111. 10, 38
neque enim conamur docere enm dicere, qui loqui nesciat. So
Eupolis (Dem. 8) said of Phaeax λαλεῖν ἄριστος, ἀδυνατώτατος
λέγειν (Meineke Com. 11. 461).

20. navus Bentley prints gnavus, which has however but
little support srom the MSS. From Cicero's words (Orat. 47, 158)
not-ierant, et navi et nari, quihus cum in praeponi oporteret, dulcius
visum esl ignoti ignavi ignari dicare quam ut veritas postulabat,
it might seem that the forms with g were unknown to him. But
gnavus is often found in good Ciceronian MSS. and is admitted
by the best editors (eg. Halm in de Imp. Pomp. 7, 18): nurus
seems nowhere to occur, nor is gnotus actually found except in
the grammarians. It is very doubtful whether gnavus is from the
same root as gnarus, the meaning being entirely different <Corssen
Ι. 83): but cp. Curt. Gr. Etym. 1. 220. forum for business pur—
poses, as in Ep. 1. 19, 8, not (as Lewis and Short take it there)
for legal or political pursuits: cp. cedere furozto become bank-
rupt, and de Imp. Pomp. 7, 19 lmsc ralia pecuniarum..quae in
fimo versatur. vespertinUS, Roby ξ 1017, S. G. ἓ 4 52.

21. dotalibus coming to him through his wife, and therefore
not due either to inherstance, or to his own energy and business
skill. emetat, only found here.

22. Mutus, probably the name of a real person, known to
Horace’s readers. Orelli remarks that Horace, though often
borrowing his types of character from Lucilius, does not limit
himself to them. Mutus is found as a cognomen on an inscrip-
tion, quoted by Bentley, who restored the true reading for the
vulgate, Illucz'us, z'ndzgnum.

indignum, an exclamation, as in Ov. Met. V. 37 nisi post
altaria Phineus isset, et (z'ndzgrnuml) scelerato profuit ara. Am.
1. 6, 1 Ianilm‘, z‘ndzgnum, dum relagata catena. So malum,
mirum, nejfas, etc. Macleane’s indignum quod sil, is much less
good. quod sit, Roby ἕ 1740, S. G. ἓ 740.

24. quicquid, etc. Cp. Soph. Aj. 646 ἅπανθ’ ὁ μακρὸς
