Bk. 11. Ep. η] NOTES. 297

Cicero, and then with an apology: cp. de Leg. 1. 16, 45 prudeus.
et, ut ita dicam, catus. Horace has it in Carni. 111. 12, 10, catus
iaculari. Cp. Reid on Cic. Acad. 11. 30, 97.

40. zonam: for the custom of carrying money in a belt cp.
the passage from a speech by Gaius Gracchus, preserved in Gell.
XV. 12, cum Romam profectus sum, zonas, quas plenas argenti
extuli, eas ex provincia z'mm’s rettuli. This practice does not
seem to be mentioned in classical Greek [ch. Anab. 1. 4, 9
quoted by Mr Yonge is not an ins tance]: but cp. Matth. x. 9,
μὴ κτήσησθε χρυσὸν μηδὲ ἄργυρον μηδὲ χαλκὸν εἰς τὰς ζώνας ὑμῶν.
So Livy XXX111.29‚4 negotzwamlz s ’¹¹1me causa α) <⁷ culum in zonis
habentes commeatibus mant. In Plaut. Irin. 802 sealor zonatuts
is a ‘cut-purse'.

41. contigit: Ep. Ι. 2, 46 (note).

42. Achilles: cp. Quint. Ι. 8, 5 optime institutum est ut al)
Homero atque Vergilio lectio z'nczseret: Ptin. Ep. 11. 14, 2 in foro
pueros a centumviralibus causis auspicari ut ab Homero in sclzolz's.

43. bonae agreeing with Athenae ‘kind’‚ almost equivalent
to grato below. Others, not so well, connect the word with
artis, comparing Tac. Ann. 1. 3, 4 Agrzppom rudem bonarum
amum.

44. vellem: the MSS. vary here between vellem, possim, and
possem: but Keller seems to be right in saying that the frrst has
the most authority, while the last (though preferred by many
good recent editors) has the least. With vellem, ut must be taken
as consecutive ‘so that it was my desire¹‚ i.e. ‘and inspired me
with the wish’: with possem, ut would probably be final ‘that it
might be in my power’.

rectum carries with it the mathematical sense of a ‘right'
line, as well as the moral sense; and hence is opposed to curvus:
so pravus originally means ‘crookedss and our ‘wrong’ is what
is ‘wrung' aside or perv.erted Skeat quotes from Wyclif‘ wrung
nose' sor ‘crooked nose’. Persius IV. 12 again imitates Horaceb:
rectum discernis, ubi inter cm va subit, vel cum fallet pede regula
varo.

1 dzquzoscere, retained by many editors, is quite without au-
tionty‚

45. silvas Academi: cp. Eupolis frag. 3² Mein. ἐν εὐσκίοις
δρόμοισιν Ἀκαδήμου θεοῦ, whence Diog. Laert. 111. 7, calls it
γυμνάσιον προάστειον ἀλσῶδες. The enclosure sacred to the hero
Academus lay about three-quarters of a mile outside the walls of
Athens on the road which ran through the Outer Ceramicus to
Colonus. Its olive groves and plane-trees were famous: they
