300 HORA TI EPISTULAE.

60. Bioneis. Bion the Borysthenite, a teacher of philosophy
at Athens towards the end of the fourth century and the be·
ginning of the third, a pupil of the Academy, Crates, Theo-
phrastus, but especially Theodorus the Cyrenaic (called the
Atheist), was more distinguished as a wit than as a philo-
sopher. Diog. Laert. IV. 46—57. Acron says in libro, quem
edidit, mordacissimis salibus ea, quae apud poetas sunt ita
laceravit, ut ne Homero quidem parceret, which is in harmony
with the words of Diogenes εὐφυὴς ἦν καὶ παρῳδῆσαι.. ,καὶ ὅλως
καὶ μουσικήν καὶ ’γεωμετριαν διέπαιζεν. Cic. Tusc. Disp. 111. αὗ,
62 gives an example of his coarse wit as directed against
Agamemnon. in quo faselum illud Bionis, perinde slzcltissz'mum
regem zn luctu capillum slbz' evelleae, quasi calvitio memor
levaretur. Among other sharp sayings ascribed to him is τὴν
φιλαργυρίαν μητρόπολιν πάσης κακίας εἶναι, which may be the
source of 1 Tim. 6, 10. The Bion, No. 7 in Dict. Bz'og. is
undoubtedly to be identified with the Borysthenite, though there
distinguished from him. sermonibus, ‘ satires’: Horace’s satires
have with one exception little or nothing of the cynical profligacy
which seems to have marked the writings of Bion.

sale nigro, ‘coarse wit': black salt would be at once
stronger and less refined than the purified condiment. Cp.
Sat. 11. 4, 74: 1. 10, 3.

61. tres, the smallest number of guests, who could sorm
a party: cp.Gell.XI11.11, 2 [M. Varro z'n satzrz's fisenippczs]
decit conc ιε α) mn mmm um mczpete opo) tere α Gratiarum numero
et pumogndz' ad lllnsamm. But even in so small a number there
would be differcnces of tastes. propezfem, ‘I might almost
say’.

62. muitum: Ep. Ι. 10, 3 mullum dissimiles,

63. renuis tu, quod: Bentley read renuis quod tu, but the
change in the leading subject is rather agreeable than otherwise.

64. sane, not concessive, as Orelli, but intensive wi-th in-
visum: cp. v. 132 below, 11. 1, 206. acidum keeps up the
metaphor of the feast, and seems especially to refer to wine.

65—80. Fomfflzly, the distractions of life in Rome are so
great that it is impossible to compose.

65. praeter, ‘beyond’, rather than ‘beside⁷: cp. Reid on
Cic. pro Sull. 3, 7

67. sponsum3 ‘to stand security', Sat. ΙΙ. 6, 23 Romae
sponsorem me rapis. Ep. Ι. 16, 43.

auditum scripta: the nuisance of recitations soon became
almost intolerable at Rome: cp. Cic. Art. 11. 2, 2 coniurasse
