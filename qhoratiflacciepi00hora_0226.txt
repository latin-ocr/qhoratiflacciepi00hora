190 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

Lz‘t. 1. 309) says: ‘We see that most (ἲ) of his friends thought
more of the value of his sarm than of its beauty‚ and turned first
to the question whether it grew corn or oil, because there was a
profit to be got out of oil‚ while corn could not be depended
upon sor more than a living'. This last statement is correct
(ep. Mommsen Hz'st. ΙΙ. 375, 6), but it may be doubted whe-
ther the fact was in the mind of Quinctius. The various alter-
natives are not, strictly speaking, mutually exclusive: the
orchard was sown like any corn-field, and where the vine was
trained on living trees, corn was cultivated in the intervals
between them (Mommsen ΙΙ. 364 note).

bacis, here, as always (Ribbeck Proll. Verg. p. 391), better
established than baccis.

opulentet, a rare word, found for the first time here.

3. an pratis. Keller strenuously, but not successfully,
defends the reading et pratis, which would join two substan-
tives, not more closely connected than any other two in the

3}th Bentley restored an from the vet. Bland. and other good

amicta: Ep. Ι. 7, 84 (note). I cannot think, with Macleane,
that these two lines are ‘to be understood as a description‚’ and
that Horace is recounting the different productions of his farm.
H. puts aside the question as to the productiveness of his estate,
and dwells in preference on its natural charms.

4. forma ‘nature’ or ‘character’: Varro R. R. 1. 6, 1
formae cum duo genera sint, una, quam natura dat, altera,
quam sationes imponunt etc.

loquaciter, i.e. with all the fulness of a proud owner. The
most recent descriptions of the estate are to be found in Martin's
Horace (Vol. ΙΙ. p. 233), and in the Antiquariczn Magrazine for
June 1883: cp. also the account in Milman's Lz'fi’ ofHorace (p.
101), and that reprinted in Martin's Horace (Ancient Classics for
English Readers) pp. 70—72 from the Pall Mall Gazette. The
main point at issue is whether the sarm lay on an elevated pla-
teau near Rocca Giovane (as Rosa thinks), or on the right bank
of the Digentia, two or three miles further up the valley, opposite
to the village of Licenza. The latter view is far more probable.

5. continui montes, not quite, as Conington, ‘in long con-
tinuous lines the mountains run’: there are no marked moun-
tain chains in this part of the Sabine territory, but rather a
broad continuous mass, broken only by the valley of the
Digentia, running from north to south. The most conspicuous
of these mountains is the Monte Gennaro (4¹63 ft.), rising high
above the'rest as seen from the plain of the Campagna: this
