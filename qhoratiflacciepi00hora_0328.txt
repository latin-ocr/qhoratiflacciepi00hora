Δγ. 165. 301: but our authorities do not enable usto determine
the date of the change. Mommsen ascribes it to about B.C. 15.]

6. verna, a slave bred at home, and therefore fit for do-
mestic duties, not mere field-work.

ministeriis, dat. with aptus. ad nutus ‘ at the beck’:
cp. Cic. Or. 8, 24 ad eorum arbitrium et nutum totos se fingunt;
and sor the plural ad Fam. XII. r regios omnes nutus tuemur.

7. litterulis imbutus ‘with some slight knowledge of
letters’: imbutus of itself carries a depreciatory, not an in-
tensive force, as Ritter says: cp. Ep. 1. 2, 69 (note), and Cic.
T usc. 1. 7, 14 an lu dt'alcctl'cz's ue imbutus quidem es: Suet. de
Gramm. 4 apud maiores, ait Orbilius, cum familia alicuius
venalis produceretur, uon temere quem litteratum z'n titulo, sed
litteratorem inscribi solitmn esse, quasi non pe7sectmn luteris,
sed imbutum. The diminutive litterulis adds to the disparaging
tone: Schiitz indeed denies that it can refer to the extent of the
knowledge, only to the nature of the subject. But it does not
matter much whether we say e.g. ‘elementary lessons in
chemistry', or ‘Iessons in elementary chemistry'. Cp. Cic.
Att. V11. 2, 8 Chayszsppum vero, quem ego propter litterularum
nescio quid libenter vidi, in honore luzbuz', discedere a puero!

arti cuilibet: an educated slave might be used as a reader
(anagnostes), copyist (librarius, scriba) or amanuensis (servus
ab epistolis). Cp. Ter. Eun. 472 ff. en eunuchum tibi, quam
liberali fizcie, quam aetate integra ! ...fac periclum in litteris, fac
in palaestra, in musicis: quae liberum scire aequomst adules-
centem sollertem dabo.

8. imitaberis, the reading of all the best MSS. has been
altered into imitabitur by some copyists, who did not understand
the figure of speech, and therefore fancied, oddly enough, that
the boy was being praised for skill in modclling. Acron rightly
explains id est, lauti ingenii est ut flectas eum quo velis tamquam
m‘gillam udam. Pers. ΙΙΙ. 23 has mlum et molle lutum es of one
still capable of training. For the construction cp. A. P. 33.

9. indoctum ‘in an untrained sashion’: Roby ἕ 1096, S. G.
ξ 461. bibenti, when a man would be less critical. The dealer
does not lay too much stress upon his slave’s accomphshrnents,
sor fear of leading the purchaser to think that there must be
serious saults to account sor his being offered so cheap.

10. levant: leviorem faciunt, minuunt Comm. Cruq.

11. extrudere, quite equivalent to our ‘push off’. The
Blandinian MSS. with Keller’s third class have excludere, which
Cruquius wishes to read: ‘excluduntur enim quae claustris
