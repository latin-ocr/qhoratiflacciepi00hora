‘amusement’ (Sat. 11. 2, ¹07)· undique ‘from any source’=
quoquo. modo.

dum...donat ‘by giving him’: dnm is used with an inten-
tional negligence in two slightly varying senses. septem ses-
tertia, at this time worth about 2660.

83. nitido ‘trim townsman’: Martin ‘dapper cit'.

84. crepat, cp. Sat. 1. 3, 13, reges atque [esraa-clm, omnia
magna, loquens: ‘has nothing but furrows and vineyards on his
lips’. Cp. Carm. 1. 18, 5; Cic. de Orat. 11. 22, 94 (note); Cic.
ad Att. IX. 13, 1 mera scelera loquuntur.

praepatat uImOS, i-e. sor vines, which were trained to grow
up them, as still in Italy: cp. Carm. 11. 15, 4 platanusque caelebs
(which could not be used sor this purpose, because of its broad
and shady leaves) evincat ulmos: Epod. 11. 10, adulta vitium
propagine altas maritat populos .· Verg. Georg. ΙΙ. 361 summasque
sequi tabulata per ulmos, Here Mena is represented as pruning
the tabulata or tiers of branches by removing intermediate
boughs and superfluous twigs. ‘The trees were planted in rOWS‚
forty feet asunder, if the land between them was tilled for corn

(as was usually the case), otherwise twenty feet3 the distance ‚

between the trees in the row was to be twenty feet. The trees
as they grew were to be pruned, so that the first seven or eight
feet of their stem might be free from branches. Above that
height the branches on each side were to be formed into tabulata
or stories, three feet asunder, and not in the sanie plane, on
which the vines might be trained. The vine was to be planted a
foot and a half from the tree. Colum. V. 7, de Arb. 16, Plin.

Pliny adds nobilia vina non m'sz' in arbustis gigni and sexto anno
maritantur.

85. studiis dat. as in Quinct. IX. 3, 73 immori legationi.

segetzs certa fides; Sil. Ital. VII. 160 of the Falernian district
dives ea et nunquam tellus mentita colono.

enectus: Priscian tx. 6, 34 quotes this line and compares
Livy (XXI. 41) fame fingore, illuvie squalore enecti and Cic. Τ use.
1. 5, 10 enectus siti Tantalus (in a quotation frorn an unknown
poet), adding ‘sed proprie necatus ferro, nectus vero alia vi per-
emptus dieitur’. Neue (Formenlehre 11. 554) gives other in-
stances of enectus but quotes only Pliny for etm‘atus. Ritter’s
notice that Mena worked his ox to death in trying to make up
for his losses is a little farfetched: it is simpler to suppose that
the soil of the farm was stony.
