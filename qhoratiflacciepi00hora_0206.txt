170 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

EPISTLE XIII.

This letter is nominally addressed to a certain Vinius, who
has been charged with the delivery of some of Horace’s poems
to Augustus. From the jest in v. 8 it is clear that his cognomen
was Asina, or perhaps (as Porphyrion calls him) Asella; the
more usual form of the name being however Asellus (e-g..
Claudius Asellus in Cic. de Orat. 11. 64, 258, Annius Asellus
in Cic. in Verr. Act. ΙΙ. 1, 41, 104). Acron calls him C. Vinius
Fronto, giving Asella as his father’s cognomen. From his
possession of three names it is clear that he was not a slave : on
the other hand the tone, which Horace adopts in addressing
him, shows that he was not, as some have supposed, a friend of
the Emperor. It is a plausible conjecture, although nothing
more than a conjecture, which finds in him one of the five
yeomen farmers on I‘Iorace's Sabine estate (Ep. 1. 14, 3). The
real purpose of the letter was doubtless to indicate to Augustus
that Horace had no intention to thrust his trifles upon him,
when not in the humour sor them. It has been generally
assumed that the wlmm'na contained the first three books of the
Odes. If this was the case, we must assume that this Epistle
was considerably earlier than Epist. 1, the first lines of which
cannot have been written immediately after the publication of
the first important collection of Horace’s lyrics. There is
nothing in this letter which tells against Franke's (very generally
accepted) view, that the first three books of the Odes were
puhlished together in B. C. 23. Nor on the other hand is there
anything in it inconsistent with Christ's belief that they were
not pnblished before B.C. πο. This question must be decided
by other considemtions, mainly by the interpretation ofCarm. Ι. 3,
and ΙΙ. 9. Cp. XVickham's Introduction.—Augustus was absent
from Italy from the latter part of ΗΟ. 22 until October B. C. 19.
It has been generally assumed that Horace sent Vinius from his
Sabine villa to Augustus at Rome. If so, the date assigned by
Christ becomes untenable. But he argues with some force thet
as Horace’s publishers, the Sosii, were at Rome, it is much
more probable that a copy of his poems was sent from the
capital to Augustus when he was still abroad. Certainly the
language of v. 10 is almost too exaggerated to be humorous, if
applied to the five and twenty miles or so of excellent road (the
via Valeria and via Tiburtina) which lay between Varia and
Rome. Ritter supposes the date to have been the early part of
B.C. 18, which is probably too late. Cp. Introduction.-——There
is little ,to be said in favour of the view, which some have
adopted, that the Satires were the volumina sent at this time to
Augustus. The Satires were probably completed by B.C. 303
