47. eadat elusus ‘soiled and overthrown’‚ a metaphor from
a gladiator. ruentis acervi ‘the diminishing heap’, in Greek
σωρείτης ‘quam, si neeesse sit, Latino verbo liceat acervalem
appellare' (Cic. de Div. 11. 4, 11). The nature of it is explained
by Cic. Acad. 11. 16, 49 captiosissimo genere interrogationis utun-
tur, quodgenus minime in philosophia probari solet, cum aliquid
minutatim et gradatim additur aut demitur. Soritas lzoc vocant,
quia acervum efficiant uno addito grano. Cp. also ΙΙ. 29, 93 with
Reid's note. Chrysippus met the difficulty by refusing to answer
some time before his questioner reached the critical point: he
was so troubled by the sophism that Persius humorously calls it
his own, VI. 80 inventus, Clnysz'ppe, tnifinitor acervi. We must
carefully distinguish the sorites as a logical trick playing upon the
meaning of the word ‘heap’ (σωρός) from the similarly named
but wholly different ‘chain-argument’ (kettenscliluss), in which
the predicate of each of a string or ‘heap’ of premisses is the
subject of the next. Cp. Jevons Logic p. 156, or Thomson's
Laws of Tliongltt, p. 199. Forcellini 5. ν. confuses them: the
definition in the dictionaries based on Freund ‘a sophism
formed by accumulation’ does not really suit either. Some
editors say that the argument which proceeded by way of addi—
tion was called the struens acervus, that which went on gradually
diminishing was called the ruens acervus. I cannot discover the
authority sor this statement.

48. redit in fastos ‘goes back upon the annals’.

49. Libitina: an ancient Italian goddess, originally of gardens
and of pleasure generally, called also Lubentina (from lubet, lu-
bido, etc.). Asterwards she came to be regarded as the goddess
of burial, by a transition strange to us, but not unexampled in
Italy, where the Sabine Feronia is compared both with Flora
and with Persephone, and in Greece where Aphrodite sometimes
is represented as Persephone: cf. Preller Ram. lllytli. p. 387,
Griecli. Mytlz. 1. p. 275. Servius Tullius is said to have or-
dained that in every case of death a piece of money should be
contributed to her chest; and biers and other neeessaries sor
funerals were kept in her grove (lucus Libitinae) on the Esquiline,
and let out on hire. Here too the undertakers (Libitinarii) had
their quarters. Cp. Carm. 111. 30, 63 Sat. 11. 6, 193 Mart. x.
97; Liv. XL. 19. 3 pestilentia ..tanta erat, ut Libitina ad funera
vix sufficeret (Madvig): XLI. 21, 6 ne liberorum quidem funeribus
Libitina siffciebat.
