364 ARS POETJCA.

152. discrepet: Cic. de Fin. v. 28, 83 respondent extrema
primis, media utrisque, omnia omnibus.

153-178, T lze characters of the drama are to he handlea' in
accardum-e witlz llze tendencz‘es of their several times osli e.

153. tu, as general¹ asin v. 119, 128, etc. The line is
somewhat weak, and could well be spared, or transferred to
aster 155, as Peerlkamp suggest53 but we have seen frequently

that a certain tone of negligence was intentionally preserved by
Horace in this epistle. '

154. plausoris: Bentley attacked this reading of the MSS.
and scholiasts, on the ground that it would be intolerable with
plaudite so soon following. But his suggestion fautoris is no
improvement. A firmor or claqueur would be sure to stay to
the end. A dramatist desires, not the patient attention of
personal friends, or hired applauders, but the genuine interest of
the general audience. Meineke and Peerlkamp read for si
plausoris, spectatoris, and Schiitz⁷s arguments do not convince
me that this would not be sar better, if we ventured to desert
the MSS. But plausor need not be limited to a paid elaquemg
as Schiitz seems to think; it may denote one who persistently
applauds (Ep. 11. 2, 130): and applause was not confined to
the end of the play, as wc see from many references in Cicero.

aulaea: Ep. 11. 1, 189 note.

155. cantor: in the best MSS. of the Trinummus of
Plautus and of all the plays of Terence, the characters are
denoted not by initial letters, but by Greek capitals‚ and when
the same actor took two parts, the same letter was prefixed to
each (Ritschh Praef. Trin. p. lv.). To the word plaudite, with
which a Latin comedy always closes, is prefixed ω. Bentley
supposed that this was a corruption sor CA, i.e. cantor (on
Ter. Andr. v. 6, 17): but this is inconsistent with the use of the
other Greek letters (cp. Ritschl, Proll. Trin. p. xxx.). Now the
word [αηίον may take one of two meanings, whence much con-
fusion has crept into our authorities: for canere is used both of
playing on the flute, and of singing with the voice. In a
Roman play, as Ritschl first clearly showed, there were three
kinds of dehvery, (1) rechation, (ε) recitative, and (3) lyric
song. The first was proper to iambic diverbia, unaccompanied
by the flute: the second to iamhic or trochaic septenariam,
accompanied by the flute (and included in the term cantica)
(cp. Cic. Tusc. Ι. 44, 107 cum tam bonos sepfenarz'os fimrlat ad
tibz'am): the last to the lyric monologues, which were always
sung, and which were cantica proper. Livy VII. 2 tells us that
Livius Andronicus, having been encored in these last until he lost
his voice, introduced the custom of having a young slave, standing
