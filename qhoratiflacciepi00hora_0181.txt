Bk. Ι. Ep. VIL] NOTES. 145

65. tunicato: the cumbrous toga was seldom wom by the
poorer classes at Rome, except on ceremonial occasions. Tac.
Dial. 7 volgus imperitum et tunicalus hic populus. Augustus
was annoyed at the disuse of the national dress, and forbade the
citizens to appear in the foxum or circus without the toga
(Suet. Aug. 40). In the country it was still less used: Juv.
111. 171 pars magna ltaliae est...in quo nemo togam sumit

nisi mortuus (cp. Mayor's note); Mart. X. 47‚· 5 toga rara,-
51. 6 tunicata quies.

scruta, ‘odds and ends', the connexion commonly asserted
with the equivalent Greek ’γρὺτη is doubtful: cp. Vanicek
p. 210 and 1121. Scrutator: scruta :z clzzjffonier :chzffvu

66. οοοιιρπεφθάνει, comes upon him before he sees him.
prior: the inferior would naturally be the first to offer a salu—
tation3 cp. Mart. 111. 95, 1 nunquam dicis ‘ave', sed reddis,
Naevole, semper...cur lwc expectes a me, rogo, Naewle, dicas,
nampulo, nec melior, Naevole, nec prior es.

67. excusate ‘began pleading...as his reason'. Cic. Phil.
lx. 4, 8 excusare morbum.

mercennaria: all good MSS. here (as usually) give the nn,
where the first n represents the assimilated d of merced, the

second a suffix -0n.· cp. Roby ξ 942, 1. The meaning therefore
cannot be (as Macleane says), ‘the bonds of buying and selling’,
which would involve no merces, but his salaried duties‚ ‘hireling
bonds': cp. Sat. 1. 6, 86 si praeco parvas...mercedes sequerer.

68. domum ven-isset, for the morning salutatio, which
would be expected from an inferior after the compliment of such

an invitation.

69. providisset: cp. Plaut. Asin. 447 non hercle te provide-
rem: quaeso ne vitio vertas ; Ter. Andr. 183 erus est, neque pro—
videram. sic...si ‘on condition that' Roby ἓ 1571.

70. ut libet ‘as you please', i.e. if you wish it.

⁷2. dicenda...tacenda‚ i.e. whatever came into his head,
with no suggestion of blame, as in Demosth. de C01·.§ 157 καὶ
βοᾷς ῥητὰ καὶ ἄρρητα ὀνομάζων. There is a similar asyndeton in
sanda nefanda (Catull. Lxxv. 405); cp. Cic. Tuse. V. 39, 114,
where there is a series of such contrasts. In Pers. 1v. 5 the
phrase is used quite differently: see Gildersleeve's note or Con-
mgton. ,
73. dimittitur ‘is allowed to go home.’ Orelli's notion

that Mena needed a kindly hint that it was time for him to go is
not required. Like all the compounds of millo, dc'zm'tto often

means to allow to go, rather than to send.
