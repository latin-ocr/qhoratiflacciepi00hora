the will of heaven with regard to a contemplated act, i. e. the
augur: unless the passage from the Odes is an exception, it
is never used of the man under whose auspices anything is done
(cp. Bentley ad loa), but of the deity who sends favourable signs:
Verg. Aen. 111. 20, VI. 452 Ov. Fast. 1. 615. In the case of
the nuptiarum auspices (Cic. de Div. 1. 16, 28, cp. Marquardt
Rom. Alt. V. 45—6‚ Mayor on Juv. Χ. 336) we have the mean-
ing of ‘director,' ‘superintendent’, derived irom the primary
sense.

ampullatur, ‘dash on his colours,’ a metaphor derived not,
Ι think, from the shape of the ampulla, but from its use to hold
pigments: cp. Cic. ad Att.1. 14, 3 nosti illas ληκύθους ‘you know
how I put the paint on there’; cp. Plin. Ep. 1. 2, 4: so ληκυθί-
§ew in later Greek. Callimachus called tragedy >xmw'0‘cos Μοῦσα
(Frag. 319). There is no connexion whatever (as Orelli sup-
poses) with the gibe in Arist. Ran. 1208 sq. on ληκύθιον ἀπώ-
λεσεν, which turns solely on the rhythm. The more usual inter-
pretation, however, of ampullari is ‘to swess’, assuming that
the reference is to the round belly of the ampulla: cp. A. P. 97.

Celsus, probably the same as Celsus Albinovanus, to whom
Ep. V111. of this book >is addressed.

16. privatas opes ‘stores of his own ’, avoiding too close
an imitation of the classic writers who had already found their
place in the public lihrary. Here too Horace is only giving a
kindly warning, and is not, as some have supposed, gravely
censuring Celsus for plagiarism.

17. Palatinus Apollo. In B.C. 28 Augustus had built a temple
on the Palatine to Apollo in commemoration of his victory at
Actium (Dio Cass. LIII. 1): and addidit porticus cum biblio-
theca Latina Graecaque (Suet. Aug. 29.) This building was
close behind the palace of Augustus, so that when the emperor
was in ill-health, the senate was summoned to assemble there
(Suet. 1. c. Cp. Boissier Pmmenades Arclze‘olczgiques p. 70).
Mr Burn (Rome, p. 175) says ‘the cloisters which surrounded
the temple united it with the famous Greek and Latin library’:
but it seems rather that the porticus contained the libraries,
and not a distinct building‚ of which there is no trace. It is
plain, too, from inscriptions in which they are mentioned se·
parately, that the Greek and the Latin Libraries were quite
distinct, e. g. in the famous columbarium discovered in 1852
