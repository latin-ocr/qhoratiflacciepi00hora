100 ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE.

Horace uses the Greek form in the Odes, the Latin in the Satires
and EpistleS‚ except perhaps in Sat. 11. 5, 81.

13. hunc, Agamemnon, not Achilles, as some have sup-
posed. The affection of Achilles is not noticed in the first book
of the Iliad, to which Horace is here referring, but in lx. 342 ὠς
καὶ ε”γώ τὴν ἐκ θυμοῦ φίλεον (cp. Carm. 11. 4, 3). On the other
hand Agamemnon says in 1. 113 καὶ ’γάρ ῥα Κλυταιμνήστρης
προβέβουλα. urit ‘fires ', a term as applicable to love (Sat. 1. 9,
66) as to tage.

14. quicquid, Roby ξ 1094, S. G. ξ 461. plectuntur, Sat.
11. 7, 105 tergo plector ‘I pay for it with my back '. The word
is often used of undeserved or vicarious punishment: cp. Ov.
Her. XI. 110 a! miser admisso plectitur ille meo! (with Palmet's
note). ’

15. seditione, as in the case of Thersites ΙΙ. 11. 115 ff.
dolis, Pandarus IV· 134 ff.

scelere perhaps especially referring to Paris, libidine including
not only the passion of Paris for Helen, but also the tyranuous
caprice of Agamemnon.

17-26. lee Odysscy cm tlte otlzer hand shows us the valae qf
[ourage and sefficontrol.

19. qui domitor...undis‚ an imitation of the first five lines
of the Odyssey: cp. A. P. 141.

providus, a very inadequate substitute for πολύμητις.

21. dum parat, line 2. ‘ in trying to secure ’, ἀρνύμενος : the
attempt was unsuceessful in the case of the socii.

23. Sirenum voces Odyss. ΧΠ. 39 ff„ 154—200.——Circae
pocula Odyss. Χ. 136 ff.

24. stultus cupidusque, ‘in soolish greed': Odysseus did drink
of Circe's cup, but only after he had been supplied by Hermes
with a prophylactic antidote (Od. x. 318).

25. meretrice, a strong term intentionally ch osen for emphasis
‘a harlot mistress⁷. Though Circe is undoubtedly a type ofsensual
plcasure, there is nothing in the legend attaching to her which
justifies so strong a term.

turpis ‘in hideous form ⁹, i.e. transformed into the shape
ofa brute (Carm. 11. 8, 43 Sat. 1. 3, 100).

excors ‘void of reason' (Sat. 11. 3. 67). For cor as the seat
of the reason cp. Cic. Tusc. Ι. 9, 18, de Orat. 1. 45, 198 (note).
