1. Quid tibi visa. ‘ what did you think of?’ Orelli needlessly
supposes a confusion between quid tihi videtur dem? and qualis
tila· videtur? Cp. Ter. Eun. 273 scd quid videtur lloc tibi
mancipium? Cic. ad Fam. 1x. 21. 1 quid tibi videor in cpia-lulis?

2. concinna ‘ handsome', apparently from the sine buildings
which adorned it, especially the famous temple of Juno: ccm-
cinnus usually carries the meaning of neatness and regularhy,
and therefore cannot mean (as Ritter says) grata ct apta ad
habitandum. Augustus spent two winters there, B.C. 31—30‚
and R.C. 30—29.

regia ‘ royal seat’ t Sardis is nom. plur. αἱ Σάρδεις.

3. Zmyrna: no good MSS. give the form Smyrna, either
here or in Cicero (cp. de Rep. 1. 8, 13, pro Balb. 11, 28, Phil. xx.
2, 5). The views of the grammarians are discussed by Mr Ellis,
Catullus-2 p. 344. Cp. Munro on Lucret.1V. 1 12 6.

mnorave fama: a much· -disputed passage. The MS. evi-
dence seems decidedly in sav our of minmave, not mznonme.
Keller warmly supports the former, reading fama? and takes it
as a poetical equivalent for el celcra, interpreting ‘what did you
think of the other towns, whether greater or less in repute?’
eg. Ephesus, Miletus, Pergamum, etc. Munro has the sa'me
reading, without comment. It is not possible to translate ‘ were
they greater or less than their reputation. ³² sor -ve is never used
in disjunctive questions, where two alternativ es are contrasted.
(Cases like Verg. Aen. x. 93 ant egro lala d di, sbz 'iz ι Cupidine
bella? are quite different.) Is this is to be the meaning, it is
necessary to read minor anesanm. 9 But it is better with Dillen
burget to place a comma after minorave sama, translating‘ are
all, whether greater or less than their reputation, oflittle account
in your eyes compared with?’ etc.

4. sordent? Some editors print a comma here, instead of
beginning a fresh question with an venit: the point is not of
rnuch importance, but it is perhaps better if we read minorave,
to make the first question end at sordent. There is no gram-
matical objection to -ne, an, an, introducing three alternatives.

campo, at once the finest part of Rome, since the erection of
stately buildings there by Agrippa and otherS, and the scene of
its most sashionable life.

5. An venit, etc. ‘or have you set your heart upon one of
ssfiygitiels of Attalus as your horne? eg. Pergamum, Apollonia,
