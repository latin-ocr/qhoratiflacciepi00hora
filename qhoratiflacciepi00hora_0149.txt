Bk. 1. Ep. HL] NOTES. 113

Suetonius (Aug. 81) says that Augustus quia calidasomenla uon
proderant, fr ι 'trtdis curari coactus a actore Antonio Musa. The same
cold- water bandages which would reduce inflammation might
naturally be regarded as chilling a healthy glow. If curarum
is the objective genitive, we must give to fomenta the meaning
of ‘remedies’, (as in Cic. Tusc. 11. 24, 59 llaec sunt solacia,
llaec fomenta summorum dolorum: cp. Epod. x'l. 17 ingrata fo-
menta vulnus nil malum levanlia), and translate frigida ‘seeble’,
‘powerless’‚ as in Ov. Pont. lv. 2, 45 quid nisi Pierides, solacia
Ῑνιζίιία, restat? But this leaves it too obscure what is meant
by ‘the unavailing remedies against cares' which Florus is to
abandon. Orelli's way of taking curarum as a genitive of origin,
fomenta arising from cares, leaves the origin and application of
the term fomenta quite unexplained. The dictionaries based on
Freund translate ‘nourishment’, i.e. all that feeds your cares,
an unexampled meaning, though supported slightly by the use
of the word for ‘fuel’ according to Serv. on Verg. Aen. 1. 176.
Macleane says fomenta are here glory and such like rewards,
which I do not understand.

27. caelestis, which elevates one above such low earthly
cares. ires. Roby§ 1530 (c), S. G. ἓ 638.

28. opUS, the· task assigned( (ἔργον), studium the chosen
pursuit (προαίρεσις). So Ritter: Orelli s practical and theoretical
pursuit of wisdom' 1s less probable. parvi et ampli, small and
great alil< e can devote themselves to wisdom. properemus, Ep.
1. 2, 61.

29. nobis cafi, cp. Ep. 1. 18, 101. carus is not so much
‘beloved', as ‘highly esteemed '-

30. sit has much more authority than si: Bentley has shewn
that either would stand by itself (cp. Ep. Ι. 7, 39; Βοὺγὲ 1755,
S. G. ἓ 747); but sit requires a full stop after MunatzQus anda
note of interrogation at the end of the sentence beginning an
male, so that this may be a direct question. With Bentley's
cst, which has no authority, Ι (10 not see how to account for
conveniat. Macleane’s sull- -stop at resci'ndzlur is positively bad
grammar3 if sz can be used where we might have expected an
with the subjunctive, yet there is no instance in which this is
followed by an.

31. male sarta gratia, a metaphor srom the scu ing up osa
wound, which, if1t does not heal, will breal open again: sarcire
