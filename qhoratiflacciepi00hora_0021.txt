Born in Rc. 65, Horace was studying at Athens
at the time of the death of Caesar in B.C. 44.
He joined Brutus, and was made military tribune,
thus occasionally at least taking the command of a
legion. In 13.c. 43 he appears to have been with
Brutus in Asia (Sat. i. 7, 18>z in B.C. 42 he took part,
though not a very distinguished part, in the battle of
Philippi. His return to Rome probably followed in
the next year; but some time must be supposed to
have elapsed before his talents can have won for him
the friendship of Vergil and Varius, and warranted
them in introducing him to Maecenas. After the first
introduction‚ nine months passed before Maecenas
admitted him to his circle (Sat. i. 6, 61). Hence we
cannot well assign to this an earlier date than B. C. 39.
With this date correspond the indications of Satire i.
5, apparently to be ascribed to 13.C. 37, and of Sat. ii.
6, 40, written, as it seems, in 13.c. 31, when the friend-
ship had already lasted seven 01· eight years. In the
latter year Horace was already in possession of his

when he received it, but apparently it was not long
before this time. During the time covered by the
Satires (about B.C. 40—30) Horace does not appear
