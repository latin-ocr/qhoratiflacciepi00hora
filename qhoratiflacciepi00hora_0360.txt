324 HORATI EPISTULAE.

pinguibus, ‘rich’ i.e. productive, as osten of soil: e.g. Ep.
1. 3, 5, Verg. Georg. Ι. 14 pinguia dumeta, ib. lv. 118pz'nguz‘s
hortos, etc. Sch'utz says ‘productive of rich palm-oil', and the
‘Globe’ version has ‘unctuous’. I cannot find any authority
for supposing that palm-oil was known to the ancients: Pliny
says nothing about it in describing the palms (N. H. xm.
26—50)‚ and the palms of Jericho were certainly date-palms.
Ritter oddly says ‘ ubi pinguia unguenta parantur delicatis ho-
minibus iucunda'.

185. importunus ‘merciless', both to others and to himself.
Cp. Ep. 1. 6, 54 (note), Palmer on Sat. ΙΙ. 5—96.

186. mitiget, ‘reclaims', cp. pacantur in Ep. 1. 2, 45.
This passage is rather against the notion of Lachmann on
Lucret. V. 1²03 that pacare there refers to the expulsion of
wild beasts. fiammis: ‘Palladius directs that when land is
covered with trees, a distinction must be made between that
which is naturally good and that which is poor, as from the
former the timber should be merely removed, and the land
ploughed up (vomerezferro): whereas in the latter it should be
burned, in order that the soil may be enriched with the ashes
left behind '. (Darffieny, Roman fflrsbandry, p. 94.)

18¹7. Genius: Ep. ΙΙ. 1, 144 (note). natale...astrum.
Horace tells us (Sat. 1. 6⁷ 114) that he was fond of standing by
the astrologers in the Circus, and listening to their predictions,
without any great saith in thern: in Carm. 11. 17, 17—22 he
uses the language of astrology merely as poetical ornament, and
in a manner which shows his own indifference to it3 in Carm.
1. 11 he condemns it as an idle superstition. Persius, as usual,
imitates the language of Horace, and like him does not profess
to know what his own horoscope is (V. 45—51). Aster the time
of Horace, astrology received a considerable impulse at Rome
from the patronage of Tiberius: cp3 Tac. Ann. ΙΙ. 27, 23 32, 53
VI. 20, 3, and Hist. Ι. 22, 2 mathematici&..genus hominum...
quod in civitate nostra et vetabitur semper et retinebitur. Cp.
Mayor on Juv. Χ. 94.

temperat ‘controls': Pers. l. c. has the same word, but in
a different sense: quod me libi temperat aslrzmz ‘a star which
suses me with you’.

188. mortalis: viewed in itself, and as a part of the divinity
which rules the universe, the genius is immortal, as Apuleius
says (de deo Socr. c. 15) z's deus, qui est animus suus cuique,
quamquam sit immortalis, samen quodammodo cum lzomz'ne gzgr·
nitur. But as regards the individual (in unum quodque caput)
it is mortal‚ and on the death of the man to whom it is attached,
it returns into the universal soul of the world. Of the Stoics
