si raro scribes, ut toto non quater anno membranam poscas.
Probably at this time the author’s own copy was made on durable
parchment, and copies for sale on the cheaper papyrus. Cp.
Becker Gallus³ 11. 372. Birt, in his careful discussion of the use
of parchment in Das antz'ke Budawesen, thinks that parchment
was used sor the first sketch‚ because writing could be cleaned
-osf it, better than off charla of papyrus. Cp. pp. 56 ff.

introduced τελετὰς καὶ χρησμῳδίας, but in Rep. 11. 364 E he
attacks the mendicant prophets who ‘produce a host of books
written by Musaeus and Orpheus, who were children of the
Moon and of the Muses—that is what they say—according to
which they perform their ritual'. Aristotle doubted the genuine-
ness of the poems current under the name of Orpheus (de An. 1.
5, 15), and, if Cicero de Nat. Deor. Ι. 38, 107 reports him cor-
rectly‚ even his existence. The Orphica now extant are mainly
later than the Christian era. Cp. K. O. Miiller Gr. Lil. 1.

rabidosque: this reading is supported by many of the best
MSS. including Bland. vet. and Bern„ and is therefore to be ac-
cepted. Reller from his point of view thinks that the scale turns
decidedly in favour of rapidas. That rapidus may mean ‘flerce'
is sufficiently proved by Vergil’s use of the word of heat (Ecl. 11.
10: cp. Conington‘s note), of the sun (Georg. 1. 92), of fire
(Georg. IV. 263) and of the dog-star (il). 425). But here there
