216 ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE. ⁵

23. argenti: if this be taken as denoting money, there is
tautology in the next line3 besides the character here described
is one who is reproved not for greed of money, but sor wishing
to make as much display as a sar richer man. Hence Schiitz
takes argentum as ‘plate', as in Ep. 1. 6, 173 16, 76; 11. 2, 1813
Carm. lv. 1 ῐ, 6, Sat. 1. 4, 28. fuga (v. 24) is then the attempt to
avoid a reputation for poverty‚ rather than poverty itself. But it
is difficult to resist the force of the parallel auri safra fames and
the like, which point to the the meaning · money '.

tmportuna ‘insatiate’: cp. Palmer on Sat. ΙΙ. 5, 96.

25. decem vitiis instructior cannot be ‘furnished with ten
times as many defects ' as Macleane and others translate: dacem
is merely a definite number chosen sor the sake of vividness,
instead of the indefinite ‘many'‚ as we might use ‘a <lozen⁷.
Orelli weH compares Plaut. Merc. 345 (Goetz) ita animi decem
in pectore incerti certant. Cp. A. P. 365. The ablative is that
of measure aster a comparative.

26. regit ‘ schools him’.

28. prope vera ⁴ pretty nearly true'. Ep. 1. 6, 1. conten-
dere=certare os v. 31.

30. arta—toga ‘ a toga of little breadth'. The toga seems
unquestionably to have been osan oval form [cp. Rein in Becker’s
Gallus3 111. 143], but folded, as a rule, along the greater axis
of the ellipse. Hence in wearing it the breadth would be mea-
sured from the shoulders downwards; and a toga, if too broad,
would be either inclined to trail‚ or would be necessarily arranged
in too elaborate folds. In Epod. lv. 8 Horace speaks of an
ostentatious sellow Sacram metiente viam cum bis trium ulna·
rum toga. Orelli is quite right in explaining this as ‘ toga quae
propter longitudinem ad imos talos demissa metiatur viam, id
est, eam semper tangat et radat ’, although Macleane, from not
undet-standing the way in which a toga was arranged, rejects
this view. For Sat. 11. 3, 183 cp. Palmer's note ad loc.

comitemzclt'cntem. There is no reference to a journey.

31. Eutrapelus a name given to P. Volumnius, a Roman
knight, to whom Cicero addressed two of the letters in his col-
lection adFamz'lt'am’s (VH. 32, ancl 33), on account of his polished
wit. Cp. Ar. Rhet. 11. 12, 16 καὶ φιλογέλωτες [οἱ νέοι]· διὸ καὶ
εὐτράπελοι· ἡ ’γὰρ εὐτραπελία πεπαιδευμένή ὕβρις ἐστίν. From
Eth. Nic. ΙΙ. 7, 13 and IV. 8, 10, it is seen that εὐτραπελία was
regarded by him as the just mean between βωμολοχία ‘buf-
soonery' and ἀγροικία, the ‘boorishness’ which is deficient as
regards το ἡδὺ τὸ ἐν παιδιᾷ. There is a very interesting discussion
