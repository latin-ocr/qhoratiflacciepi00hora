Bk. II. Ep. IL] NOTES. 301

mallem quam restitisse coniurationi, sz' illum mz'lzz' audiendum
putassem: Ep. 1. 19, 39. Mayor on Juv. 111. 9.

68. cubat, ‘lies sick'. Sat. Ι. 9, 18 trans Tt'berz'm longe
cubat is: (where Palmer quotes Ov. Her. xx. 164 llaec cubat, ille
valet), II. 3, 289 malcr ait pueri menses iam quinque cubantis.
The Quirinal was at the extreme N .E.‚ the Aventine quite at
the S.W. of the city.

¹10. humane ‘prorsus ut ἐπιεικῶς’ Or. i-e. :proban admodum ‚·
and no fatal objection lies against this force of the word. lzu-
manus like ἀνθρώπινος (cp. Dein. in Mid. 527 ἀνθρωπίνη καὶ
μετρία σκῆψις) often means ‘ reasonable’: so Cic. Phil. XIII. 17,
36 moderate aut humane. Cp. ad Att. XIII. 52, 2 homines visi
sumus ‘we showed ourselves reasonable beings'. Many editors
have hesitated to accept it. Ribbeck conjectures (very badly)
homini uni, as if two men would have found the distance
shorter! Frohlich suggested haud sane, which has naturally
met with much approval. If we suppose that HAVTSANE
became by the obliteration of two letters H V I ANE the ccr—
rection to HVMANE must have followed as a matter of course.
There is also strong confirmation srom Terence, whom Horace
seems to have known by heart, in Adelph. 783 edepol com-
missatorem haud sane commodum. But the parallel of ἐπιεικῶς
is too close to allow us to say with confidence against all MS.
evidence that Horace could not have used humane. We do
not gain much by assuming with Schiitz that humane points to
a man as the measure of the convenience, ‘convenient sor one
who is but a poor human being'. This is an equally unexampled
use, and destroys the parallelism. Another plausible suggestion
is that of Jeep (in Kriiger‘s Anhang) insane commoda, comparing
Plaut. Mil. 24 insane bene (but there A has insanum).

verum. ‘Yes but you say’, introducing an objection‚ with
the force which at enim so often has in prose. Verum assents,
but introduces a qualification: cp. KiIhner II. 686.

71. plateae is marked pldtfaz in the dictionaries based on
Freund and in GeorgeS, with this passage and Catull. XV. 7
noted as exceptional instances of the short penultimate. But it
is short also in Plaut. Trin. 840 sed quis lzz'c est qui in plateam
ingreditur (an anapaestic dimeter), Ter. Andr. 796, Eun. 344,
1064, Phorm. 215, Adelph. 574, 582. I can find no instance of
the long penuhimate, which might have been expected from the
derivation of the word from πλατεῖα, (cp. Philem. Frag. 55 Mein.
τὴν πλατεΐάν σοι μόνῳ ταύτην πεποίηκεν ὁ βασιλεύς;) earlier than
Prudentius Perist. lv. 71 Christus z'n totis habitat plateis ; and
Auson. Ep. X. 22. &Vc have a parallel to the shortening in
baliarum from βαλανεῖον chorda, gynaechaem, etc. (Roby ἓ 229).
Macleane says ‘it suits Horace to shorten it’.
