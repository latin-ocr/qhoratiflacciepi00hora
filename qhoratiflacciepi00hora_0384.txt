But although Julius Caesar intended to attempt this work (Suet.
Jul. XL1V.)‚ and perhaps met with some partial success, reclaim-
ing some land which Antonius proposed to divide among the
poorer citizens (Dio. XLV. 9), there is no evidence that it was
carried out by Augustus: and Mr Long (Notes on Plutarch Caes.
LVIII.) points out some engineering difficulties which would
make the complete fulfilment of the task almost impossible.

67. seu cursum mutavit amnis, Porphyrion says ‘ Tiberim
intellegamus: hunc enim Agrippa derivavit, qua nunc vadit:
antea per Velabrum fluebat'‚ and similar notes are given by
Acron and Comm. Cruq. But the Velabrum was drained by the
Cloaca Maxima in the time of the kings, and the Tiber never
flowed through it. Suet. Aug. XXX. says ad coercendas inun-
dalz‘ones alveum Tiberis laxavit ac repta-gavit, completum olim
ruderibus et aedt'ficiornm prolapsionibus coartatum: but of this
we have no further details. For the inundations of the Tiber
cp. Carm. Ι. 2, 13—20: but fivtgihus shows that in this place
the damage done to the city cannot have been prominent in the
mind of Horace. But the three instances of great works of men
here mentioned as perishing are strikingly parallel to what Plut.
Caes. LVIII. says of the schemes of Julius Caesar: ‘He had also
a design of diverting the Tiber, and carrying it by a deep chan-
nel directly from Rome to Circeii, and so into the sea near Tar-
racina, that there might be a safe and easy passage sor all mer-
chants who traded to Rome. Besides this he intended to drain
all the marshes by Pomentium and Setia, and gain ground
enough from the water to employ many thousands of men in
till-age. He proposed further to make great mounds on the
shore nearest Rome, to hinder the sea from breaking in upon
the land, to clear the coast at Ostia of all the hidden rocks and
shoals that made it unsafe for shipping, and to form ports and
harbours fit to receive the large number of vessels that would
frequent them. These things were designed without being ear-
ried into effect’. Now it seems pretty clear that the draining of
the Pomptine marshes was never carried out to an extent suffi-
cient to justify Horace‘s language, if taken strictly. There is
great probability therefore in the view of Preller (Aufsc'itza
p. 515 ff.) that Horace has in view throughout the designs of
Julius rather than any works actually executed by Augustus. It
would be a very doubtful compliment to the reigning emperor to
take gieat engineering operations of his as instances of works
doomed to pass away; whereas it would be natural for him to
speak thus of gigantic schemes commenced a quarter of a cen-
tury before and never completely carried out. We must there-
fore suppose Horace to be using a kind of poetic anticipatum,
‘assuming the great dictator's plans to have been achieved‚
still they are destined to fail in the long run’. So Nettleship l.c.
p. 52 note.
