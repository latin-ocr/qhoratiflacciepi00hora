42. calo is properly a soldier' s servant, and so Ritter takes
it here, supposing that the calo envies the vi'lzcus his enjoyrnent
of what he himself cannot get in the camp. But the word came
to mean, not only a groom in general (Sat. Ι. 6, 103), but any
low servant, or drudge (Sat. 1. 2, 44: Senec. Ep. cx. 17 lectica
fhrmosz‘s imposita calom'bus): hence it is better to regard it as
= nzeszastmus

argutus‘ shrewd' as in Sat. 1. 10, 40, A. P. 3643 the man
is sharp enough to know where he would be better off. Mac-
leane’s suggested alternative ‘noisy is quite out of place.
besides, when applied by Horace to persons with reference to
the voice, it is always a term of praise· cp.Carm.111. 14, 21,
Ν. 6, 25, Ep 11. 2, 90.

43. piger goes best with caballus ,· it is not only laziness
which makes one dissatisfied with his condition3 and the ox
would have had a more active lise, if he could have taken the
place of the horse. The rhythm points in the same direction.
but not very cogently: cp. Ep. 1. 5, 7: 6, 483 11. 2, 75. Many
editors take it as going with both substantives.

44. quam scit etc. The line of Aristophanes (Vesp. 1431)
ἔρδοι τις ἧν ἕκαστος εἰδείη τέχνην had passed into a proverb, as
we see from Cic. Tusc. Ι. 18, 41 bene enim illo proverbio Graeco
praeczpitur: quam quisque norit artem, in hac se exerceat.

EPISTLE XV.

This Epistle must have been written after the famous
physician Antonius Musa had brought the cold-water treatment
into fashion by his cure of Augustus in the year 13.C. 233 and
probably not long after, although the arguments by which
Ritter attempts to fix the date as the autumn of B.C. 21 are
more ingenious than convincing. Horace writes to a friend, who
is called in the MSS. inscriptions C. Numonius Vala, to tell him
that he cannot spend the coming winter, as he had previously
done, at Baiae, and to make enquiries about Velia and Salernum.
He humorously compares himself to a certain Maenius who
liked to have the best of fare, when he could get it, but put up
readily with plain dishes, when nothing better offered.
