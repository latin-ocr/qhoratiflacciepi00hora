the demi-gods who received honours only after their deaths.
Augustus is the one exception to the rule Virtutem incolumem
odimus. But Mommsen rightly takes this also as a proof that
this Epistle cannot have been written before the return of
Augustus to Rome in B.C. 13. It would be otherwise incon-
ceivable that the poet who wrote abes iam nimium diu (Carm.
IV. 5, 2) should throughout make no reference whatever to his
absence, it he was now spending his second or third year in

Gaul.

16. iurandas aras: iurare, like ἐπομνύναι (Ar. Nub. 1237
ἐπώμνυς τοὺς θεούς), ἀπομνύναι (ib. 1232 καὶ ,ταῦτ’ ἐθελήσεις
ἀπομόσαι μοι τοὺς θεούς;)-ορ. Ζεὺς ὀμνύμενος (ib. 1241)-—takes
an accusative of that by which one swears (Verg. Aen. xii.
197 terram, mare, sidera iuro): hence it can be used'in the
passwe.

numen has in its favour not only the vet. Bland. but also
the excellent MS. R, although the majority of MSS. have
nomen: the former was restored to the text by Bentley, and has
since received the support of many good editors. Kr'tiger and
Schiitz still prefer nomam but the regular phrase was either
iurare per numen or iurare in nomen. Suet. Calig. ²4 has
per numen Drusillae dem-avit: and in Tac. Ann. 1. 73 all good
recent editors have adopted the correction of Freinsheim violatum
periurio numen Augusti, though the MS. has nomen. Cp. Ov.
Her. IX. 371, XI11. 159, Pont. 1. ιο, 42. Servius too who
quotes these lines on Verg. Ecl. Ι. 7 and Georg. Ι. 24 has
(according to the best MSS.) numen, and adds ‘ sic Lucanus de
Nerone [Phars. 1. 63] sed mz'lzz' iam numen '. ·Mornmsen holds
that this phrase cannot refer either to the altar to Fortuna redux
dedicated when Augustus returned to Rome in Β. C. 19, or to
that of Pax Augusta oi July B. C. 13, because neither of these
deities could have found a place in oaths. It must refer, he
holds, to the invocation of the genius Augusti between luppiter
optimus maximus and the Di Penates, which was part of the
remodelling of the worship of the Lares Compitales. This appears
to have been due to a decree of the senate, passed during the
Emperor’s absence, although not sully carried out until a later
date. Cp. Carm. IV. 5, 34 Laribus tuum miscet numm. Cp.
Corp. I. Lat. 11. 172 sz‘ sciens fallo fefellerove, tum me liberosque
meos Iupiter optimus maximus ac divus Augustus cetem'que omnes
di immortales expertem patria incolumitate fortunisque omnibus
saciant (found at Aritium vetus in Lusitania).
