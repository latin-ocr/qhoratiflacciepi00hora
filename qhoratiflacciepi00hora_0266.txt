230 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

whetstone and razor were buried. In any case the former was
the more famous by far, so that it could be named by Cicero and
Persius without any qualifying epithet.

9. siccis: cp. Carm. 1. 18, 3 siccis omnia nam dura deus
proposuit.

11. nocturno—diurno. This line curiously resembles in
rhythrn A. P. 269 Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna ; it
has even been supposed to contain a parodying reference to it,
which is just possible. if we accept with Prof. Nettleship the
earliest date assigned to the Ars Poetica. For olere v. 5
Horace substitutes the stronger word putere.- cp. Mart. Ι. 29
Hesterno foetere mero qui credit Acerram, fallitur: z'n lucem
semper Acerra bibit. The epithet diurno is not however quite
correctly attached he e to the wine: the meaning is ‘they stink
all day of the wine which they vie with each other m drinking at
night’‚ not, as in Martial, that they sit up drinking into the next

(lay. Cp. Carm.1v. 1, 31 mc certare iuvat mero ‘to join the
drinking pbout’ Page.

12. pede nudo: Plutarch says of Cato of Utica (c.V1)
πολλάκις ἀνυπόδητος καὶ ἀχίτων εἰς τὸ οημόσιον προῄει μετ’ ἄριστον,
and in c 1. speaks of the firm and irnmoveable expression of his
nce. Some have thought that Horace is referring here rather to
the elder Cato, doubting whether he would have ventured to
choose Caesar's bitter enemy as his type of virtue, and reminding
us that the younger was himself only an imitator of the elder.
But Carm. Ι. 12, 35 Catonis nobile lesum seems answer enough
to the first: to the second we may reply that it is sar more in
harmony with the context to understand a contemporary as the
object of imitation, than one who had died more than a century
before. Cp. Mommsen Hist. IV. 156. ‘A strange caricature of
his ancestor...he even formed a school, and there were individuals
—it is true they were but a few—who in their turn copied and
caricatured afresh the living pattern of a philosopher ⁷. Cic. ad
Att. 11. 1, 10 speaks of Servilius as Catonis aemulator, and often
mentions Favonius, who we learn from Dio XXXVIII. 7 was
called the‘ ape of Cato': Mommsen applies to the latter the
hardly less uncivil phrase ot Cato’ s Sancho (IV. 315 ). Cp. the
proverb‘ cucullus non tacit monaehum'.

13. textore, if taken as a kind of instrumental ablative (see
on v. 3) needs no correction.

15. rupit ‘ruined’t many editors suppose that Iarbitas
strained himself till he burst, in the attempt to rival Timagenes
in loudness of voice and fluency of speech; but this is quite
inconsistent with urbanus. It seems rather that he brought
himself into trouble by imitating the bitter wit of Timagenes.
