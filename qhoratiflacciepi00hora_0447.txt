turning· post, (2) goal. The former is sar the more common;
e. g. in Verg. Aen. v. 159 metamque t nebat (cp-1-9 vtr'nlem
frondenti ex ilice metam) means ‘he was just at the point 11 here
he had to turn round: Conington apprehends the meaning, but
repeatedly uses the term ‘³³goal to denote this point: surely this
is not legitimate3 the ‘goat' was the portus altus of v. 243, by
reaching which the race was won. L. and S. are clearly wrong
in taking the meta here as the winning-post. Cp. Carni. Ι. 1, 4
metaque ftrvidis evitata rotis. Cic. pro Cael. 31, 75 in hoc flexu
quasi aelatz'sfamcz adulescentis paulum haesit ad melas. But the
word is frequently used metaphorically in the sense osa limit:
Verg. Aen. 1. 278 his ego nec melas rerum nec tempora pono: 111.
714 longarum llaec meta viarum. In Ovid Art. Am. 11. 727 ad
metam proper-alc simul the word is used metaphorically in its
literal meaning, as in Trist. Ι. 9, 1 detur inoffiwso vilae libi tan-
gere metam: in IV. 8, 35 the plural is used, apparently in the
sense of ‘goal’: nec procul a metis, quas paene tenere videbar,
curriculo gravis est facta ruina meo, 1 can find no passage in
prose in which mela is used for ‘goal’ except Varro L. L. V111.
16, 31 siquis duplicem putat esse summam, ad quas melas naturae
sit perveniendum in usu ; the regular word is calx ‚¹ Ep. 1. 14, 9.
Gr. {imrMyffzstarting-point, not goal, as Rutherford says on
Phrynichus p. 146. Cp. Plat. Phaedr. ²54 E There is a striking
parallel in the use of καμπτήρ for ‘goal'2 cp. Cope on Ar. Rhet.
111. 9, 2 ἐπὶ τοῖς καμπτῆρσιν ἐκλύονται.

one of the chief contests was in the νόμος Πύθικος, a desc1iption
in music of the fight of Apollo with the Python, including a song
of victory and a dirge over the monster. This was introduced
by Olympus (Miiller Greek Lit. Ι. 209), but was not limited to
the pipe3 the lyre was also used (Curtius Hz'st 11. 82, Bergk
Gr.th.11. 127). The victor at the first three Pythian contests,
after they passed into the hands of the Amphictyons (Β. C. 590),
was Pacadas (Miiller, p. ²15)-

416. nunc is the reading of all our older authorities, andis
quite defensible: ‘nowadays men think it enough to say’. Bent-
ley contended that the contrast was not between the present time
and the past, but between athletes and poets; and therefore
read on very slight authority nec, which has been very generally
accepted. But surely this is to force too strictly logical an expres
sion upon Horace. 'lhere is no lack of clearness in saying
