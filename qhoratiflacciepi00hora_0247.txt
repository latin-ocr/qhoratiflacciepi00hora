Bk. Ι. Ep. XVIII.] NOTES. 211

hard to suppose that there would have been no reference in
vv. 55—57 to the fact that Tiberius was in the East at the same
time as Augustus. Resides, the elder Lollius was a bitter enemy
of Tiberius (Suet. Tib. X11.; Tac. Ann. 111. 48). Ritter thinks
that the epithets venerandus (v. 73) and potens (v. 86) prove that
it must have been some member of the imperial house, and that
Tiberius and Agrippa are both excluded by the fact that they
were absent at this time from Rome, while Augustus is plainly
not intended: hence he assumes that Claudius Drusus, the younger
brother of Tiberius, at this time 18 years of age, must be referred
to. It is better to leave the question undetermined.

The tone of the epistle has been severely censured by some
editors: e.g. by Macleane. But the key to it seems to be found
in the epithet liberrime of v. 1. This means more than ‘of an
ingenuous disposition’, as Macleane renders it. Taken in con·
nexion with v. 5 ff., it plainly denotes an outspoken frankness‚ in
danger of passing into offensive rudeness. Horace blames in the
most explicit language all unworthy servility, and points out the
dangers and vexations of a court-life very frankly. But seeing
that his young friend is embarked upon it, he gives him the
advice which his temperament seemed most to require. That a
man who is thrown into the society osone superior to himself in
social station should not offend him by persistently obtruding his
own opinions on matters of trifling importance, by displaying his
own vices and follies, by prying into secreta and betraying thern,
by finding fault with his friend's tastes and pursuits, by incon-
tinent loquacity, and by introducing to him unworthy acquain-
tances, is surely nothing ‘ very degrading’ and is far removed from
refined servility.

however we may take amicum as directly governed by professus,

3. meretrici: the long vowel in the second syllable is very
rare: but this passage shows that Roby Ι. 94 (note), S. G. p. 16
(note) is not right in saying that it is never found.
