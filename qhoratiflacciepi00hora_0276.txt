²40 ΗΘΚΛ TI EPISTULAE.

inertes, ‘barbarous’ in the earlier sense of the word= cp.
Cic. de Fin. ΙΙ. 34, 115 (artes) quibus carebant inertes a maio-
ribus nominantur. So Kriiger and Schiitz take the word, so
that we have an anticipation of Juvenal’s (ΙΙΙ. 207) divina opici
rodebant carmina mares. Others render ‘sluggish', but then the
epithet, though not unsuitable, is somewhat otiose.

13. fugies of your own accord to find kindlier treatment
in the provinces, where what was out of (late at Rome, might be
regarded as a welcome novelty: mitteris by the bookseller.
vinctus ‘tied up' as a parcel of goods: Bentley completely
disposed of the earlier reading unctus. There is still a reference
to the fate which might besall a slave who had fallen into habits
of vice. Cp. Liv. xxv. 2. Africa and Spain were at a later
time famous seats of Latin learning—In A. P. 345 Horace
mentions as a sign osa good book that it was sent into the
provinces: so Mart. XII. 3. So now-a-days the book-markets
of the colonies are supplied both with popular novelties, and
with ‘ remainders ’.

14. monitor, sc. Horace himself. ut ffle etc. The source
of this allusion is not known to us. There seems to have been
some story of a donkey-driver, who could not get his ass away
from the edge osa precipice and so, losing his temper, gave
him a push which sent him over.

15. rupes ‘clisfs' as in Caes. B. G. Π. ‘29 oppidum egregie
natura metullum cum ex omnibus in circuitu partibus altissimas
rupes despectusque haberet.

alie· servare: cp. A. P. 467 invitum qui servat, idem facit
occi enti.

18. occupet ‘should come upon you’: Tibull. 1. 10, 40
quem...0ccus³at ia parva pigra senecla casa. The language is
still that which might be used alike of a book and a boy:
‘stammering age shall find you teaching boys their letters in
distant (and therefore low) quarters of the town’. In Sat.
n. 3, 274 it is said of an old man cum balba feris annoso verba
palata, but in a somewhat different sense: there halba verba
are ⁶ lisping words oflove ’. In Juvenal’s time Horace was already
used as a school-book (VII. 226 cnm tatus decolor esset Flaccus
et haereret m'gro saligo lllaronz': cp. Mayor's note), though in
Sat. 1. 10, 75 he by no means desires such a fate sor himself.

humble birth, and llze favour l leave-famul wlllz tlte great, af my
looks, my temper, and my age.
