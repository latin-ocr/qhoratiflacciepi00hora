Bk. II. Ep. 11.] NOTES. 303

before could only be understood of Rome. This would certainly
be the case, if nemus, used in a generic sense, had not come
between: but the parallelism justifies us, I think, in following
the best MSS. Cp. Juv. V11. 57, Ov. Trist. 1. 1, 41, for the
commonplace of the poet’s love of retirement.

78. rite cliens Bacchi ‘in loyal allegiance to Bacchus'.
rite=‘as is fit’. Cp. Carm. 11. 19, 111. ²5·

79. strepitus: Carm. 111. ¹29, ια fumum et opes strepitumque
Romae. The continual noise at Rome is one of its worst terrors‚

as painted by Juv. Sat. 111.

80. contracta: the vet. Blana'. had cantata, evidently only a
correction for the reading of the great majority of MSS. contacta,
which is clearly indefensible‚ as Bentley showed. He argues him-
self in favour of non tacta, but contracta which he rejects contume-
liously (⁶ quasi vero poetae, quo nobiliores, non eo maiora et clariora
vestigia post se relinquant’), really comes to much the same
thing: paths which few have trodden, and which therefore offer
no broad beaten track. Conington rightly has

‘Tread where they tread, and make their sootsteps out'.

[contracta does not give the right contrast to strepitus. Possibly
cdtata is a corruption ospacata. J. s. R.]

81—86. Retirement from the world makes a man ridiculam
even in a quiet town like Athens: and lww can J venture to
pursue my studies at Rome ?

The connexion of these lines with the context is not very clear,
and the thought not logically developed. Hence some have re-
jected them as spurious. But the drift seems to be somewhat as
follows. Life in Rome, as we have seen, is ill adapted for poetic
composition. But if a man grows old in studious retirement, he
unfits himself for practical life. Ι do not choose to retire from
society and make myself a laughingstock‚ a course which is needful
for true inspiration: nor, on the other hand, can I write here.
Hence expect no more lyrics from me. Some critics have oddly
enough supposed that Horace must himself be the ingenium, and
have thence argued that he must have lived seven years at Athens.
That he is not is shown clearly by the contrast with ege, and not
less by lzz'c, i.e. at Rome. Plat. Theaet. 174 has an amusing
sketch of the philosopher, how ‘on every occasion, private as
well as public, when he appears in a law-court, or in any place
in which he has to speak of things which are at his feet and
before his eyeS, he is the jest, not only of Thracian handmaids
but of the general herd, tumbling into wells and every sort of
disaster through his inexperience. His awkwardness is fcarful,
and gives the impression of imbecility' (Jowctt 1V. 324). Jacobs'
