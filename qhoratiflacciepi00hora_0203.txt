15. 1111 parvum: cp. Thuc. VII. 87, 4 οὐδὲν ὀλίγον ἐς οὐδὲν
κακοπαθήσαντες. adhuc ι5ῖὶ11, as of old’. sublimiazrd μετέωρα,
caelestia, theines such as those mentioned in the following lines.

16. quae mare conpescant causae: cp. Verg. Georg. 11. 479
qua vi maria alta tumescant obicibus ruptis rursusque in se ipsa
residant.

quid temperet annum, i.e. causes the various seasons: cp.
Carm. Ι. 12, 15 qui mare ac terras variisque mundum temperat
horis.

1⁷. sponte as the Epicureans would maintain: iussae as
the Stoics held, who believed in a controlling Deity. Vergil’s
palantesque polo stellas (Aen. lx. 21) is not parallel, sor the
reference there is to a miraculous phenomenon3 but cp. Cic. de
Rep. Ι. 14, 22 carum qumque stellarum quae ermntcs et quasi
vagae nominaremur. Hence the stellae here are the planets,
though Cic. de Nat. De. 11. 20, 51 denies that they can properly
be called ermnles.

18. premat obscurum ‘hides in darkness': obscurum is
priedicative. The reference is to the phases of the moon, not to
ec φερε.

concordia discors, an oxymoron: cp. Ep. 1. 11, 28. Cp.
Senec. Nat. Quaest. VII. 27, 3 non vides quam contraria inter se
elementasz'nt? Gravia et levia sunl, fz'igidcz et calida, umida et
sicca. Τοῖα huius mundi concordia ex discordibus constat. The
doctrine of Empedocles was (Diog. Laert. vm. 76) στοιχεῖα μὲν
εἶναι τέτταρα, πῦρ, ὕδωρ, γῆν, ἀέρα, φιλίαν τε ᾖ συγκρίνεται καὶ
νεῖκος ᾦ διακρίνεται. Cp. Reid on Cic. Lael. 7, ης and Plato
Soph. p. 242 E: ‘Ioniam and more recently Sicilian muses
speak of a one and many, which are held together by enmity
and frier21dship, ever parting, ever meeting' (Jowett’s Introduction
Vol. 111 . p. 395).

20. Stertinius is mentioned in Sat. 11. 3, 33, and called
sapientum octavus (ib. 296). The Scholiasts say that he wrote
220 books on the Stoic philosophy. Nothing else is known of
him. The name is made without change into an ad'ective‚ as is
usual with proper names: cp. lex Julia, via Appia ege„ and very
commonly in poetry, though Madvig ξ 189, 11 limits this to ‘a
man's public or political works and undertakings' ε so Kiihner
1.p.672. Cp. Carm. 1v.12,18 Sulpi'czz's. mancis. Translate

‘whether E. or the shiewdness of Stertinius dotes'.
