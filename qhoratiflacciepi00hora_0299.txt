assumed that this is the period meant. But Schiitz objects (ι)
that art and literature had reached a high development before
this date: (2) that after this time, when all arts were at their·
height, the Greeks carried on fierce wars with each other. He
therefore lays stress on nugari and vilium as indicating blame,
not sufficiently accounted sor by the manner in which the more
rigid Romans were accustomed 10 regard the accomplishments in
which the Greeks excelled; and considers that ‘wars were laid
aside’ only aster Greece lost her independence, and a ‘kindly
fortune’ preserved her from civil strife by the peace which Rome
imposed upon her subjects. In supportes this view it may be
urged that Horace is not speaking of the excellence attained by
Greece in various departments of art, but only of the capricious-
ness with which, like a spoilt child, she turned from one amuse-
ment to another. But it is hard to believe that fhrtlma aequa
can refer to the time of the national degradation of Greece, and
not to the prosperity and vigorous national lise which followed
the repulse of the barbarians. And though Horace is not giving
unqualified praise to the pursuits of the Greeks, he is certainly
commending the versatility which led them to try so many forms
of mental activity‚ and so caused the production of the new
works, which in his day -had become the ancient models. Schiitz’s
view seems to me inconsistent with vv. 90—92, and therefore to
be rejected in favour of the current explanation. nugari is com-
monly used of amusements, which are not directed by any serious

purpose: cp. Sat. 11. 1, 733 1. 9, 23 Ep. 1. 18, 60; 11. 2, 141.

94. vitium, which has been attacked by some critics, need
not denote more than an undue devotion to pleasure, inconsistent
with the rigour of earlier manners. labier ⁴ drist'. Horace uses

this archaic form of the infinitive also in Sat. 1. z, 35, 78, 104;
Π. 3, 243 8, 67 :.Ep. 11. ¹2, 148, 151. Vergil has the form six
times : it is common in Catullus and Lucretius, but occurs only
occasionally in later poets. There is one instance in the Odes,
Carm. 1V. 11, 8. For the origin of the inflexion cp. Corssen 112.
478—9. Roby ἓ 615.

95. athletarum, mainly in the great national games. Cp.
Carm. 1v. 2, 183 3, 4, sor the combination pugil...cquus.

96. marmoris aut eboris: the chief sculptors in marble or
ivory (and gold) flourished at Athens ε but the leading school of
workers in bronze was at Sicyon and Argos. The earliest bronze
statues are referred to Samos, the earliest marble ones to Chios ε

cp. Overbeck Grz'eclz. Plast. pp. 69—72.
97. suspendit* ‘let eyes and thoughts dwell in rapt attention’:

cp. Sat. 11. 7, 95—97.

98. tibicinibus may refer to dithyrambs (Miiller, Greek lit.
11. p. 77 ff.) in which the music took a prominent place, and
