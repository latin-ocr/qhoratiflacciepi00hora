fistula cera iuncta refer to a very different musical instrument.

tubaeque aemula: the lengthening of the tibia by means of
the brass vincturae would tend to make it as powerful as a

trumpet.

singular: but Gell. xx. 1, 31 has lniurias saclas XXV assibus

Bell. Afric. LXVII. 2 pauco tritici numero: Vitruv. 1. 1, 6 paucam
manum. The word is similarly used by Appuleius, and there-
fore seems to have belonged in this usage to the sermo plebeius.
parvo, found in sonie MSS. is clearly an attempt at correction.

toramine: ‘Varro ait...quattuor foraminum fuisse tibias apud
antiquos, et se ipsum ait in templo Marsyae vidisse tibias quattuor
foraminum. Quare quaterna tantum foramina antiquae tibiae
habuerunt: alii dicunt, non plus quam tria’ Acron. The tibiae
pares in the British Museum (found at Athens) are about 15 inches
long, and have five holes at the top and one underneath. Those
represented in pictures sound at Pompeii (e.g. sllusc'e de A'aples,
Vol. 111. 35, and 154) are about twice that length, but have not

the holes clearly marked.

was the first to use the word, which is probably derived from the
similar use of εὐαρίθμητος, as in Plat. Symp. 179 c. πολλῶν πολλὰ

θεοί. Cp. Theocr. XVI. 87 ἀριθματοὺς ἀπὸ πολλῶν. sane not
with numerabilis, but ‘of course'. Sch'utz takes away the comma
after parvus, that utpote may go with the adjectives of v. 207,
holding that the reason why the people carne in small numbers
to the theatre was not only because they were few, but also
because they were virtuous and temperate. But these latter
qualities would make them content with simple music, not keep
them away from the theatre altogether: this abstinence was no
virtue in the eyes of the ancient world. Or. rightly says that
cssstuscvserecundusque have reference to the religious seelings of
t e au ience.

208. urbes appears in all MSS. with one unimportant ex-
ception. Bentley adopted (in silence) the reading of some earlier
editors urbem, and Schiitz follows him, arguing that the reference
can only be to Rome, as in the preceding lines. But there'is no
reason to doubt that Greece was in the mind of Horace quite as
much as Rome, if not more so, sor there was apparently no great
change in the music or diction of the chorus at Rome. The ex·
