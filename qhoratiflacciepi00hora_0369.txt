Tiberius, and was accused of hastening the death of Germanicus.
(Cp. Tac.Ann. 11. 43, 55, 57, 69—81‚ 111. 1—18.) His younger
brother Lucius was consul in B. C. 1, and must therefore have
been born not later than ssshckgffi while it is probable that he
may have been born some years earlier. If these are the Pisos
addressed in this epistle, we have in the case of the father, as in Ι
that of Messalla Corvinus (Carni. 111. 21, 7), Sestius Quirinus ,
(Carni. 1. 4, 14), Pompeius Varus (Carni. 11. 7), and Torquatus ³
(Carni. 1v. 7), an instance of the loyalty with which Horace j
clung to the friends who had gone through with him the carn- l
paign of Philippi.

The title ‘ Ars Poetica‘, or ‘De Arte Poetica Liber’, is found
in almost all MSS. Quintilian V111. 3, 60 writes id tale est mon-
strum, quale Horatius in prima parte libri de arte poetica fingit:
and in the Epist. ad Tryph. 2 (prefixed to his Institutio) says
usus Horatii consilio, qui in arte poetica suadet, ne praecipitetur
editio, nonumque prematur in annum. Later grammar-iaus regu-
larly use the same title, and it is employed also by Porphyrion
and the so-called Acron. There is no evidence that it comes
frorn Horace himself3 it was probably invented by an early
editor, and it is not very suitable to the contents of the epistle,
suggesting, as it does, a regularity and completeness of treatment
to which the poem makes no claim, and which indeed seems to
be intentionally avoided. But a name which has been so long
in use cannot be abandoned without inconvenience; and it may
be accepted on the authority of tradition, provided we do not
allow it to mislead us as to the real character of the epistle.

Porphyrion adds to the words previously quoted in quem
librum congessit praeopta [Vcoplolemi τοῦ ΙΙαριανοῢ non quidem
omnia, sed eminentzkslma. Much difficulty has been found in
accepting this statement. Ritter altogether rejects it: ‘Nam
Horatium sua hausisse ex poeta recente et parum cognito, qualis
suit Neoptolemus grammaticus et Alexandrinorum studiis imbutus
(cp. Meinekii Analecta Alexandr. p. 375), credat Judaeus Apella'.
But it is not likely to have been a mere invention, and the case
is quite unlike that which we have just been considerfflg, where
there was probably a confusion between two persons of the same
name. Michaelis in his early dissertation de Auctoribus quos
Horatius in libro de A rte Poetica secutus esse videtur (Kiel 1857),
argued that Horace could have borrowed very little from Neo,-
ptolemus, first because Horace is above all other poets of his
time free from the influences of the Alexandrian school, with its
pedantic erudition and tortuous diction, and secondly because he
seems to have had in view in respect of meti-e mainly the practice
of his countrymen,and because his references to the early history
of the Greek drama are too confused and inaccurate to have been
derived from an Alexandrian scholar. The first of these ob-
jections is sufficiently met by Prof. Nettlesliip's reply that there
