line, where a fourth speaker is required. Cp. Soph. O. T. 276 ff.
It is a mistake also to suppose that a chorus was not introduced
in Roman tragedies: it not merely sang its songs between the
sceneS, but took part in the action (cp. Ribbeck lx’iim. Trag. pp.
637—9). But as the orchestra was fitted up with seats in the
Roman theatre‚ the chorus must have taken a place upon the stage,
and thus been more closely connected with the action than in
Greek tragedy. Aristotle says (Poet. xvut. 19) καὶ τὸν χορὸν δὲ
ἕνα δεῖ ὑπολαβεῖν τῶν ὑποκριτῶν καὶ μόριον· εἶναι τοῦ ὅλου καὶ
συναγωνίζεσθαι, μὴ ὥσπερ παρ’ Εὐριπίδῃ ἀλλ’ ὥσπερ παρὰ Σοφο-
κλεῖ. 111 Seneca's tragedies the choruses are quite unconuected
with the plot. For Sophocles cp. Campbell's Sophocles c. XIII.

194. intercinat followed by the accusative without a pre-
position as in Carni. 1. 14, 19 interfusa nitmtis aequora Cycladas.
This construction of a compound verb becomes very common in
Tacitus: e.g. Ann. ΙΙ. 9 flumen Visungrzk Romanos Cheruscosque
interfluebat (so Hist. 111. 5). ΙΙΙ. 23, qui cognitionem intervene-
rant: Drager Hist. Synt. Ι. 350.

196. bonis faveat: the chorus almost invariably expresses
the view of right-minded spectators.

197. peecare timentis is the reading of almost all MSS.
Bentley objected to it, because (1) if equivalent to boni, it is
otiose afterfizveat bonis: (2) Ep. 1. 16, 52 seems to indicate that
those who avoid sinning from sear are ‘servilia ingenia’, un-
deserving of any favour. (3) amat is not the word H. would
have chosen. Hence, on very slight authority, he read pacare
tumentis, and this reading has been adopted by some good
editors, e.g. Meineke‚ Haupt, and L. Miiller. It has been
argued that tzmzenlz‘s is at least as tautologous aster iratos as the
MS. reading after bonis, and that ametpacare is by no means a
natural expression sor pacet. The former objection Bentley anti-
cipated by pointing out that tumidus is used sor the result not
only of anger, but also of grief(Cic. Tusc. 111. 12. 26; 31, 76).
to which Orelli adds pride, comparing Sat. 11. 3, 213purum est
vilio tihi, cum tumidum est cor? Doederlein warmly defends
and Keller accepts pacare timenlis; which Bentley suggests as
an alternative, comparing Senec. Ep. le. nil stultitia pacatum
habet: tam superne illi metus est, quam infra. On the whole
there is (as Munro says) no sufficient reason for departing srorn
the MSS., though Bentley⁷s reading gives what Horace might well
have written. The chorus should show their affection sor heroes
or heroines, who though tempted to commit a sin shrink from
doing so. We may perhaps with Ritter take bonis as *nearly
equal tofhrtibzrs, those who feel no temptation to go wrong.

198. mensae brevis, i.e. osa table on which there is a cena
brevis Ep. 1. ¹4» 35.
