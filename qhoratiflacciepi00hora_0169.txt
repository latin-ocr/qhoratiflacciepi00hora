or sevum for laevum, whence Ritter repeats servum, a conjecture
which has deservedly found but little support: saevum though
admitted by some editors is not desensible.

cogat, ‘ press', with energy. trans pondera, a very difficult
phrase. The old interpreters explained it as referring to stepping-
stones placed in the road: thus Comm. Cruq. pondera lapides

suzzv: Lucret. 11. 218, VI. 574, Lucan Ι. 57, a view which,
though ignored by Macleane, has received the weighty support
of Lachmann (on Lucret. p. 381), Haupt (on Ov. Met. Ι. 13)
and Ritter‚ as well as Conington: ‘at risk of tumbling down'.
Orelli takes it of the weights on the counter of a sh0p‚ support-
ing his interpretation by the picture of a shop at Pompeii, and
Keller warmly approves: but is it possible to understand so im-
portant a limiting notion as ‘of the shop'? Others interpret
pondera of obstacles generally. The old view has recently been
advocated by T. Mommsen (Fleckeisen's Jahrb. 1874, p. 466 ff.),
Nissen (Ponzpeian. Stud. p. 566), and Kr'uger. Overbeck Pom-
peii-⁰⁵ p. 56 describes the broader streets as having three such
stepping stones (Fig. 19), the narrower, one. It is admitted
that there is no evidence, except in the scholiasts. that these were
called pondera: but in face of the difficulties still attaching to
Gesner’s interpretation (and especially to the force which it
requires us to give to trans), it is perhaps best to follow the
earlier view, which must have been based upon some traditional
authority, seeing how little there is in the words themselves to
suggest it. The picture thus suggested is that of a candidate
in the cumbrous whitened toga, pressed by his attendant to
hurry across the street in order to shake hands with an in-
fluential elector on the path opposite. The street was usually
narrow, in Pompeii never more than about ‘²4 feet broad, and
often only nine or ten, inclusiveof the paths (manganes), but the
latter were as a rule much raised.

less authority, and would necessarily refer back to ille.—cui

during the time of Augustus, who himself took part in the
canvassing (cp. Suet. Oct. XL. comitiorum ius pristinum
reduxit), and the elections of B.C. 19 gave rise to serious dis-
turbanees: it was only Tiberius who made the sanction of the
