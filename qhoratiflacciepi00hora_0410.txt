salubrem iustitiam ‘the blessings of justice’: so taken the
epithet is not out of place, as Peerlkamp thinks.

l 199. apertis portis: cp. Carni. 111. 5, 23 portasque non
causas.

200. tegat commissa, as in Sophocles Eleetr. 469, Philoct.
391, Eur. Hippol. 712, Elect. 271, etc.

oret: Peerlkamp’s suggestion to take Fortunam out of the

dependent sentence as the object, is tempting, but leaves deosque
precetur too indefinite.

202—219. T lte music, wlziclz accompanz'cd the chorus, muler-

went great changes as luxury increascd, and tlze langztag'e (ff the
chorus became more ornate.

202. tibia: the old Phrygian pipe was made originally of
a rced (αὐλὸς καλάμινος as Pollux x. 153 calls it), as we see from
the familiar story of its invention by Athena. The goddess
threw it away, finding that its use disfigured the features, and it
was taken up by Marsyas, who appears in legend and in many
works of art as the champion of ssute-playing, as against the lyre-
music of Apollo. Cp. Plin. H. N. XVI. 36, 166 calamus vero
alius totus concavus, quem vocant syringiam, utilissimus fistulis.
Asterwards the wood of the box, the lotus, and the cedar, bored
(terebrato buxo Ov. Fast. VI. 697) and pierced with holes was used
sor the purpose. This was subsequently enlarged so as to gain
a greater range and sulness of sound‚ almost equal to that of a
trumpet. and strengthened with bands of metal. (Ivory or bone
was used sor the material of the pipe: cp. Verg. G. ΙΙ. 103,
Propert. 1V. (V.) 6, 8, Plin. H. N. XVI. 35, 172 nnnc sacrificae
Tuscorum e buxa, ludicrae vero e loto ossibusque asininis et argento

fiunt, but not for bands: hence correct Dz'ct. Ant. p. 1130 b.)

Orelli, aster Fen, supposes that these large pipes were made in
pieces, and that the metal bands were used in order to put the
pieees together: this is possible, but not proved.

orichalco, a kind of yellow copper or natural brass quodprae-
cipuam bonitatem admirationemque diu obtinuit nec reperitur
longo iam tempore effita tellure (Plin. H. N. XXXIV. 2, 2). The
Greeks called it ὀρεὶχαλκος (Hes Scut. 122, Hom. Hymn. Ven.
9): the word is common in Plautus in the form aurichalcum (eg.
Mil. 658 (Tyrrell), Pseud. 688, Cure. τοῦ) and seems to be used
vaguely for a precious metal‚ though in Cure. l. 6. it is distinguished
from aarum. Verg. Aen. XII. 87 has alboque orfclzalm, where the
force of the epithet is doubtful: cp. Conington ad loc. Cic. de

Off. 111. 23, 92 speaks of it as only worth one-thousandth part
os the value of gold: cp. Holden’s note.
