328 HORATJ EPISTULAE.

vero dubitabis et indignabere obire? For ira ‘ rage’ followed ‘by
a genitive of that which occasions it cp. Liv. Ι. 5 ob iram praedae
amissae: XXI. 2 ob iram intro-‘fecti domini. ‘Anger' would not

come in naturally before vv. 210, 211. The conjecture dirae
for et ira is worse than needless.

208. terrores magicos must be taken together. Some
editors separate by a comma, taking magicos to be ‘wizards'‚

butsthfis usage is doubtful, and terrores is too general to stand by
itse ere.

sagas: cp. Cic. de Div. 1. 31, 65 sagire enim sentire acute
est: ex quo sagae anus, quia multa scire volunt, et sagaces
dicti canes. From the notion of prophetie power that of witch-
craft was easily developed: cp. Carm. 1. 27, 21.

209. lemures: Porphyrion explains ‘umbras vagantes
hominum ante diem mortuorum et ideo metuendos: et putant
lemures esse dictos quasi Remulos a Remo, cuius occisi umbras
frater Romulus curn placare vellet, Lemuria instituit, id est,
Parentalia quae mense Maio per triduum celebrari solebant'.
The derivation is of course erroneous : the origin of the word is
uncertain, but it has been suggested (cp. Vanffiek, p. 169) that
it may be connected with clemens, meaning ‘kindly’z cp. manes
Ep. ΙΙ. 1, 138 (note). The Lemures were usually identified
with the larvae, spirits who in consequence either of wicked
lives or of a violent death were doomed to restless roamings
about the world at night3 while the lares were the spirits of the
good departed ones. But sometimes the term lemures was used
to include both larvae and lares (Preller Ro'm. Mytlz? p. 499).
The festival of the Lemuria, at which they were honoured sor
three nights (on May 9th‚ 11th and 13th), is described by Ovid
Fast. v. 419—492. The connexion with Remus is simply due·
to ‘ popular etymology’.

Thessala: the Thessalian witches were said to draw down
the moon and the stars from heaven: cp. Epod. 5, 45—46:
Plat. Gorg. 513 A τὰς τὴν σελήνην καθαιρούσας τὰς Θετταλίδας;
Plin. N. H. XXX. 1, 2 lllenander Thessalam cognominavit fabu-
lam, complexam ambages fi’minarum detrahentium lunam ; Ari-
stoph- Nub. 749 γυναῖκα φαρμακίδ’ εἰ πριάμενος Θετταλὴν καθέ-
λοιμι νύκτωρ τὴν σελήνην.

210. grate numeras: ‘quod non faciunt nimium timidi
ad senectutem et mortem, quia ex natalibus multis obitum iam
propinquum perhorrescunt’ Porph. Cp. Mart. Χ. 23, 1—4 iam
numerat placido felix Antonius aevo quindeciens aclas Primus
Olympiadas, praeteritosque dies cl totos respicit annos, nec meluit
Lethes iam propiores· aquas. Cp. Pers. 11. Ι, 2.
