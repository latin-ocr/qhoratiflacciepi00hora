argues that it is necessary, if of a temple it is at least an iin-
provement to read sor cac-latum sacratum. But we may reply,
¹ without pressing the fact that visus is used sor any kind of
appearance, (1) that mirabile visu had become a stereotyped
compound expression sor ‘admirable’, (π) that the construction
of caclo with the ablative does not exclude an entirely different
construction nith the dative of the agent. Cp. Ep. 11. 1, 37.

plaining (a note which he gives also on Sat. 1. 10, 38) ‘aedem
Musarum in qua poetae recitabant'· . the recitations follow in
v. 95. But there seem to have been statues of the Muses in the
temple of Apollo and public recitations were given there, at

Capua to Rome under the later Empire: but I have found no
passage which bears out Macleane’s statement ¹ among the amuse-
ments that rich men had at their dinners were gladiators who
fought with blunt weapons’ (cp. Becker δαίίω3 111. 261—2).
If this were 5ο, he could hardly be right in translating aclprz'ma
